        <p>Arithmetic is the science of numbers. The name "arithmetic" comes from the Greek word "arrhythmos" (from the other spelling "arithmetic"), which means "number". In arithmetic the simplest properties of numbers and rules of calculations are studied. More deeper properties of numbers are studied in the Theory of Number.

        <h2 class="blog-post-title mb-4">2. Integer (natural) numbers</h2>

        <p>The first notions of numbers were acquired by people in ancient times (see \(\S\) 3). They came from the count of people, animals, fruits, various human products and other objects. The result of the counting is numbers one, two, three, etc. These numbers are now called natural. In arithmetic they are also called integers (the name "integer number" has a wider meaning in mathematics; see \(\S\) 3).</p>

        <p>The notion of natural number is one of the simplest concepts. It can only be explained by example.</p>

        <p>A row of integers</p>

        <h5 class="text-center">\(1, \,2, \,3, \,4, \,5, ...\)</h5>

        <p>continues infinitely; it's called a natural row.</p>

        <p>Euclid (3rd century B.C.) defined a number (natural) as "a plurality composed from units"; such definitions can be found in many current textbooks. But the word "plural" (or "assembly" or "aggregate", etc.) is not more understandable than the word "number".</p><br><br>

        <h2 class="blog-post-title mb-4">3. Count limits</h2>

        <p>In the early stages of society, people could hardly count. They differed from each other a totality of two and three subjects; any totality containing more subjects was united in the notion of "many". This was not counting yet, but only his embryo.</p>

        <p>Later on, the ability to distinguish between small groups developed; words for the notions <em>"four", "five", "six" and "seven"</em> appeared. The last word for a long time also denoted an indefinitely large number. Our idioms preserve the memory of this epoch (<em>"You should know a man seven years before you stir his fire."</em>)</p>

        <p>With the increasing complexity of people's economic activities, it was necessary to keep count within a wider range. For this purpose, people used the objects surrounding them as counting tools: they made notches on sticks and trees; tied knots on ropes, put pebbles in piles, etc.</p>

        <p>Various advanced tools, such as Chinese <em>"suanpan"</em> and ancient Egyptian <em>"abak"</em> (a board divided into strips where tokens were placed) originate from counting with the help of pebbles. Similar instruments existed in many peoples. In Latin the concept <em>"counting"</em> is expressed by the word <em>calculatio</em> (from here our word <em>"calculation"</em>); it comes from the word <em>calculus</em> meaning <em>coal</em> or <em>"pebble".</em></p>

        <p>The natural instrument of man - his fingers - played a particularly important role. This instrument could not store the result of counting for a long time, but it was always present and was characterized by great mobility. The language of the primitive man was poor; gestures compensated for the lack of words, and numbers, for which there were no names, "showed" on the fingers (we also use fingers to show numbers when we explain ourselves to a person who does not know our language).</p>

        <p>Naturally, the newly appeared names of "big" numbers were often based on number \(10\) - on the number of fingers on one hand; some peoples also had number names based on number \(5\) - on the number of fingers on one hand or on number \(20\) - on the number of fingers on hands and toes (see \(\S\) 4).</p>

        <p>In the early days, the expansion of numbers was slow. At first, people mastered the count within the first few dozen and only later reached the hundred. For many peoples the number \(40\) was the limit of the count and the name of an indefinitely large number for a long time.</p>

        <p>On the next stage the count reaches a new limit: ten tens, and a name is created for number \(100\). At the same time, the word <em>"hundred"</em> takes on the meaning of an indefinitely large number. The same meaning is then acquired by numbers one thousand, ten thousand, one million.</p>

        <br><br><h2 class="blog-post-title mb-4">4. Decimal number system</h2>

        <p>In modern English the names of all numbers up to one million are made up of 37 words denoting numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 11, 18, 19, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000 (for example, nine hundred eighteen thousand seven hundred forty-two). In turn, the names of these 37 numbers are usually formed from the names of the first ten numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) and numbers 10, 100, 1000 (for example, 18 = eight by ten, 30 = thirty, i.e. three tens, 300 = three hundred). This word formation is based on number 10, and therefore our system of names is called decimal system of notation. The exceptional role belonging to number 10 is explained by the fact that we have 10 fingers on our hands (see 3).</p>

        <p>The French language retains the non-decimal names of numbers 20 and 80, with 80 being called quatrevingt, i.e., "four twenty". Here we have the rest of the ancient number twenty (by the number of fingers and toes). In Latin the name of number 20 is also undecimal (viginti), but the name 80 (octoginta) is decimal; it is derived from 8 (octo). But the names of numbers 18 and 19 are formed from the name 20 by subtraction: 20 - 2 and 20 -1 (duodeviginti, undeviginti, i.e. "two from twenty", "one from twenty").</p>

        <p>The names of numbers 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900 in all modern languages are constructed on a decimal basis.</p>

        <br><br><h2 class="blog-post-title mb-4">5. Development of the concept of number</h2>

        <p>When counting individual items, the unit has the smallest number: it is not necessary to divide it into shares, and often it is impossible (when counting the stones, adding half of the third gives 3 stones, not 21/2', and it is impossible to elect a board of managers consisting of 21/2 people). However, dividing one into fractions is necessary already for rough measurements, for example, when measuring the length of steps (21/2 steps, etc.). That is why the notion of fractional number has already appeared in distant epochs (see 16 and 31). Later it became necessary to further expand the concept of number; irrational (see Algebra, 27), negative (see Algebra, 3) and complex (see Algebra, 28 and 34) numbers appeared sequentially.</p>

        <p>Quite late, zero joined the family of numbers. Originally, the word "zero" meant no number (the literal meaning of the Latin word nullum is "nothing"). Indeed, if, for example, 3 is subtracted from 3, then nothing remains. In order to consider this "nothing" as a number, there appeared bases only in connection with the consideration of negative numbers (see Algebra, 53).</p>
