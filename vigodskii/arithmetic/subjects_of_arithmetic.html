        <p>Arithmetic is the science of numbers. The name "arithmetic" comes from the Greek word "arrhythmos" (from the other spelling "arithmetic"), which means "number". In arithmetic the simplest properties of numbers and rules of calculations are studied. More deeper properties of numbers are studied in the Theory of Number.

        <h2 class="blog-post-title mb-4">2. Integer (natural) numbers</h2>

        <p>The first notions of numbers were acquired by people in ancient times (see \(\S\) 3). They came from the count of people, animals, fruits, various human products and other objects. The result of the counting is numbers one, two, three, etc. These numbers are now called natural. In arithmetic they are also called integers (the name "integer number" has a wider meaning in mathematics; see \(\S\) 3).</p>

        <p>The notion of natural number is one of the simplest concepts. It can only be explained by example.</p>

        <p>A row of integers</p>

        <h5 class="text-center">\(1, \,2, \,3, \,4, \,5, ...\)</h5>

        <p>continues infinitely; it's called a natural row.</p>

        <p>Euclid (3rd century B.C.) defined a number (natural) as "a plurality composed from units"; such definitions can be found in many current textbooks. But the word "plural" (or "assembly" or "aggregate", etc.) is not more understandable than the word "number".</p><br><br>

        <h2 class="blog-post-title mb-4">3. Count limits</h2>

        <p>In the early stages of society, people could hardly count. They differed from each other a totality of two and three subjects; any totality containing more subjects was united in the notion of "many". This was not counting yet, but only his embryo.</p>

        <p>Later on, the ability to distinguish between small groups developed; words for the notions <em>"four", "five", "six" and "seven"</em> appeared. The last word for a long time also denoted an indefinitely large number. Our idioms preserve the memory of this epoch (<em>"You should know a man seven years before you stir his fire."</em>)</p>

        <p>With the increasing complexity of people's economic activities, it was necessary to keep count within a wider range. For this purpose, people used the objects surrounding them as counting tools: they made notches on sticks and trees; tied knots on ropes, put pebbles in piles, etc.</p>

        <p>Various advanced tools, such as Chinese <em>"suanpan"</em> and ancient Egyptian <em>"abak"</em> (a board divided into strips where tokens were placed) originate from counting with the help of pebbles. Similar instruments existed in many peoples. In Latin the concept <em>"counting"</em> is expressed by the word <em>calculatio</em> (from here our word <em>"calculation"</em>); it comes from the word <em>calculus</em> meaning <em>coal</em> or <em>"pebble".</em></p>

        <p>The natural instrument of man - his fingers - played a particularly important role. This instrument could not store the result of counting for a long time, but it was always present and was characterized by great mobility. The language of the primitive man was poor; gestures compensated for the lack of words, and numbers, for which there were no names, "showed" on the fingers (we also use fingers to show numbers when we explain ourselves to a person who does not know our language).</p>

        <p>Naturally, the newly appeared names of "big" numbers were often based on number \(10\) - on the number of fingers on one hand; some peoples also had number names based on number \(5\) - on the number of fingers on one hand or on number \(20\) - on the number of fingers on hands and toes (see \(\S\) 4).</p>

        <p>In the early days, the expansion of numbers was slow. At first, people mastered the count within the first few dozen and only later reached the hundred. For many peoples the number \(40\) was the limit of the count and the name of an indefinitely large number for a long time.</p>

        <p>On the next stage the count reaches a new limit: ten tens, and a name is created for number \(100\). At the same time, the word <em>"hundred"</em> takes on the meaning of an indefinitely large number. The same meaning is then acquired by numbers one thousand, ten thousand, one million.</p>

        <br><br><h2 class="blog-post-title mb-4">4. Decimal number system</h2>

        <p>In modern English the names of all numbers up to one million are made up of \(37\) words denoting numbers \(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 11, 18, 19, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000\) (for example, <em>nine hundred eighteen thousand seven hundred forty-two</em>). In turn, the names of these \(37\) numbers are usually formed from the names of the first ten numbers \(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\) and numbers \(10, 100, 1000\) (for example, \(18\) = eight by ten, \(30\) = thirty, i.e. three tens, \(300\) = three hundred). This word formation is based on number \(10\), and therefore our system of names is called decimal system of notation. The exceptional role belonging to number \(10\) is explained by the fact that we have \(10\) fingers on our hands (see \(\S\) 3).</p>

        <p>The French language retains the non-decimal names of numbers \(20\) and \(80\), with \(80\) being called quatrevingt, i.e., "four twenty". Here we have the rest of the ancient number twenty (by the number of fingers and toes). In Latin the name of number \(20\) is also undecimal (<em>viginti</em>), but the name \(80\) (<em>octoginta</em>) is decimal; it is derived from \(8\) (<em>octo</em>). But the names of numbers \(18\) and \(19\) are formed from the name \(20\) by subtraction: \(20 - 2\) and \(20 - 1\) (<em>duodeviginti, undeviginti,</em> i.e. "two from twenty", "one from twenty").</p>

        <p>The names of numbers \(200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900\) in all modern languages are constructed on a decimal basis.</p>

        <br><br><h2 class="blog-post-title mb-4">5. Development of the concept of number</h2>

        <p>When counting individual items, the <em>One</em> has the smallest number: it is not necessary to divide it into fractions, and often it is impossible (when counting the stones, adding to two stones the half of third stone gives 3 stones, not \(2\frac{1}{2}\), and it is impossible to elect a board of managers consisting of \(2\frac{1}{2}\) (two and half) people). However, dividing <em>One</em> into fractions is necessary already for rough measurements, for example, when measuring the length of steps (\(2\frac{1}{2}\) steps, etc.). That is why the notion of fractional number has already appeared in distant epochs (see \(\S\) 16 and \(\S\) 31). Later it became necessary to further expand the concept of number; <em>irrational</em> (see Algebra, \(\S\) 27), <em>negative</em> (see Algebra, \(\S\) 3) and <em>complex</em> (see Algebra, \(\S\) 28 and \(\S\) 34) numbers appeared sequentially.</p>

        <p>Quite late, <em>Zero</em> joined the family of numbers. Originally, the word "zero" meant no number (the literal meaning of the Latin word <em>nullum</em> is "nothing"). Indeed, if, for example, \(3\) is subtracted from \(3\), then nothing remains. In order to consider this <em>"nothing"</em> as a number, there appeared bases only in connection with the consideration of negative numbers (see Algebra, \(\S\) 53).</p>

        <br><br><h2 class="blog-post-title mb-4">6. Figures</h2>

      </p>A figure is a written sign that represents a number. Originally the word "figure" had a different meaning, see \(\S7\), section 6. In ancient times, numbers were denoted by straight-line marks ("sticks"): one stick depicted one, two sticks - a two, etc. This method of recording comes from notches. It is still preserved in "Roman numerals" (see \(\S7\), section 5) for numbers \(1,2,3.\) This method was not suitable for showing any large numbers. Therefore, special signs appeared for number \(10\) according to the decimal count, and for number \(5\) according to the five-digit count by number of fingers on one hand. Signs for large numbers were later created. These signs had different shapes for different peoples and changed over time. Numbering systems were also different, i.e. ways to connect numbers to represent big numbers. However, in most numbering systems, the decimal basis plays a major role.</p>

      <br><br><h2 class="blog-post-title mb-4">7. Numbering systems for some peoples</h2>

      <p><h4>1. Ancient Greek numbering.</h4> In ancient times, so-called <em>attic numbering</em> was widespread in Greece. Numbers \(1, 2, 3, 4\) were marked with lines \(|, ||, |||, ||||.\) Number \(5\) was written with the sign \(\Gamma\) (the ancient character of the letter "pi", with which the word "pente" begins - five); numbers \(6, 7, 8, 9\) were marked with \(\Gamma{|}, \Gamma{||}, \Gamma{|||}, \Gamma{||||}.\) Number 10 was denoted by \(\Delta\) (the initial letter of the word "deca" is ten). The numbers \(100, 1000 \,and \,10\,000\) were denoted by \(\mathsf{H}, \mathsf{X}, \mathsf{M}\) - initial letters of the corresponding words. Numbers \(50, 500, 5000\) were denoted by combinations of signs \(5\, and \,10, \,5 \,and \,100, \,5 \,and \,1000\), namely:</p>

      <div class="mx-auto d-block mt-4 mb-4 text-center">
        <img src="./img/ancient_greek_numbering-1.png" class="img-fluid" alt="...">
      </div>

      <p>The rest of the numbers within the first ten thousand were written in this way</p>

      <div class="mx-auto d-block mt-4 mb-4 text-center">
        <img src="./img/ancient_greek_numbering-2.png" class="img-fluid" alt="...">
      </div><br>

      <p>In the third century B.C. the attic numbering was replaced by the so-called <em>Ionian system.</em> In it numbers \(1-9\) are denoted by the first nine letters of the Greek alphabet:<br>
      \(\alpha=1, \,\beta=2, \,\gamma \,(gamma)=3, \,\delta \,(delta)=4, \,\epsilon \,(epsilon)=5, \,faou=6, \,\zeta \,(zeta)=7, \,\eta \,(eta)=8, \,\vartheta \,(theta)=9;\)<br>
      <br>
      numbers \(10, 20, 30, ..., 90\) - by the following nine letters:<br>
      \( t=10, \,\kappa\,(kappa)=20, \,\lambda \,(lambda)=30, \,\mu=40, \,\nu\,(nu)=50, \,\xi \,(xi)=60, \,\omicron \,(omicron)=70, \,\pi=80, \,copa=90;\)<br>
      <br>
      numbers \(100, 200, ..., 900\) - the last nine letters:<br>
      \( \rho \,(rho)=100, \,\sigma \,(sigma)=200, \,\tau \,(tau)=300, \,\upsilon \,(upsilon)=400, \,\varphi \,(phi)=500, \,\chi \,(chi)=600, \,\Psi \,(psi)=700,\)<br>\(\omega \,(omega)=800, \,sampi=900.\)
      </p>

      <p>The letters (faou), (copa), (sampi) are absent in the present Greek alphabet.</p>

      <p>For the designation of thousands and tens of thousands used the same numbers with the addition of a special icon ' on the side: \('\alpha=1000, \,'\beta=2000,\) and so on. To distinguish the numbers from the letters that made up the words, they put dashes above the numbers.<br>
      \(\overline{t\eta}=18; \,\overline{\mu\zeta}=47; \,\overline{\upsilon\zeta}=407\) and so on.</p>

      <p>In ancient times Jews, Arabs and many other peoples of the Middle East had the same alphabetical numbering. It is not known for which people it first appeared.</p>

      <p><h4>2. Babylonian positional numbering.</h4> In ancient Babylon about \(40\) centuries before our time there appeared <em>positional numbering</em>, i.e. such a way of depicting numbers in which the same number can denote different numbers, depending on the place occupied by this number. Our current numbering is also positional: in number \(52\) the number \(5\) stands for fifty, i.e. \(5 \cdot 10\), and in number \(576\) the same number stands for five hundred, i.e. \(5 \cdot 10 \cdot 10.\) In Babylonian positional numbering the role played by the number \(10\) was \(60\), and therefore this numbering is called <em>hexadecimal.</em> Numbers smaller than \(60\) were denoted by two signs:</p>

      <div class="mx-auto d-block mt-4 mb-4 text-center">
        <img src="./img/babylonian_positional_numbering-1.png" class="img-fluid" alt="...">
      </div>

      <p>They had a wedge-shaped top, as Babylonians wrote on the clay tablets with triangular sticks. These signs were repeated as many times as needed, for example</p>

      <div class="mx-auto d-block mt-4 mb-4 text-center">
        <img src="./img/babylonian_positional_numbering-2.png" class="img-fluid" alt="...">
      </div><br>

      <p>The six-decimal system has arisen later than decimal, for numbers to \(60\) are written down in it on decimal principle. But it is still unknown when and how the hexadecimal system arose in Babylonians. Many hypotheses were built on this account, but none of them has yet been proved.</p>

      <p>The hexadecimal record of <em>integers</em> has not spread beyond the Assyrian Babylonian kingdom, but the <em>hexadecimal fractions</em> have penetrated far beyond these limits, to the countries of the Middle East, Central Asia, North Africa and Western Europe. They were widely used, especially in Astronomy, until the invention of decimal fractions, i.e. until the early 17th century. The traces of hexadecimal fractions are still preserved today in the division of angular and arc degrees (as well as hours) by \(60\) minutes and minutes by \(60\) seconds.</p>

      <p><h4>3. Roman numerals.</h4> The ancient Romans used numbering, which is preserved to this day under the name "Roman numeration". We use it to designate anniversary dates, to name congresses and conferences, to number some pages of a book (for example, pages of preface), chapters in books, stanzas in poems, etc.</p>

      <p>In their later form, the Roman numerals look as follows:<br>
      \(\mathbf{I}=1; \,\mathbf{V}=5; \,\mathbf{X}=10; \,\mathbf{L}=50; \,\mathbf{C}=100; \,\mathbf{D}=500; \,\mathbf{M}=1000\)</p>

      <p>Before they had a slightly different form. Thus, the number \(1000\) was represented by a sign \((|)\), and \(500\) by a sign \(|)\).</p>

      <p>There is no reliable information about the origin of Roman numerals. Number \(\mathbf{V}\) could originally have been a picture of a hand, and number \(\mathbf{x}\) could have consisted of two fives. Similarly, the sign for \(1000\) could have been made of doubling the sign for \(500\) (or vice versa).</p>

      <p>In the Roman numbering the traces of the pentameter system of numbering are obviously affected. In language of Romans (Latin) there are no traces of pentametric system. So, these figures have been borrowed by Romans from other people (very probably - from Etruscans).</p>

      <p>All integers (to \(5000\)) are written down by means of repetition of the above figures. In this case, if a larger number stands in front of a smaller number, they are added up, but if a smaller number stands in front of a larger number (in this case it cannot be repeated), the smaller number is subtracted from the larger one. For example,<br>
        \(\mathbf{VI}=6, \,is \,5+1; \,\mathbf{IV}=4, \,is \,5-1; \,\mathbf{XL}=40, \,is \,50-10; \,\mathbf{LX}=60, \,is \,50+10\)
      <br>The same digit is entered no more than three times:<br>
      \(\mathbf{LXX}=70; \,\mathbf{LXXX}=80;\) the number \(90\) is entered by \(\mathbf{XC}\) (not \(\mathbf{LXXXX}\))</p>

      <p>The first 12 numbers are written in Roman numerals as follows:<br>
      \(\mathbf{I}, \,\mathbf{II}, \,\mathbf{III}, \,\mathbf{IV}, \,\mathbf{V}, \,\mathbf{VI}, \,\mathbf{VII}, \,\mathbf{VIII}, \,\mathbf{IX}, \,\mathbf{X}, \,\mathbf{XI}, \,\mathbf{XII}\)</p>

      <p>Examples:<br>
        (\mathbf{XXVIII}=28; \,\mathbf{XXXIX}=39; \,\mathbf{CCCXCVII}=397; \,\mathbf{MDCCCXVIII}=1818\)</p>

      <p>It is very difficult to perform arithmetic operations on multi-digit numbers in this record. Nevertheless the Roman numbering prevailed in Italy till 13 century, and in other countries of Western Europe till 16 century.</p>

      <p><h4>4. Indian positional numbering.</h4> There were different numbering systems in different parts of India. One of them has spread throughout the world and is now generally accepted. It had the form of initial letters of corresponding numerals in the ancient Indian language, Sanskrit (Devanagari alphabet).</p>

      <p>Originally, these signs represented numbers \(1, 2, 3, ..., 9, 10, 20, 30, ..., 90, 100, 1000\) with their help other numbers were recorded. Subsequently, a special sign (bold dot, circle) was introduced to indicate an empty category: signs for numbers larger than 9 became obsolete and the numbering of "devanagari" became a decimal positional system. How and when this transition was made is still unknown. By the middle of the 8th century the positional numbering system was being widely used in India. Around this time it penetrated into other countries (Indochina, China, Tibet, Central Asian republics, Iran, etc.).</p>

      <p>A decisive role in the spread of Indian numeration in Arab countries was played by the guidance of Al-Khorezmi, The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing, compiled in the early 9th century by <em>Muhammad from Khorezm</em> (now Khorezm region of Uzbekistan). It was translated into Latin in Western Europe in the 12th century. In the 13th century, Indian numeration prevailed in Italy. In other countries of Western Europe, it was adopted in the 16th century. Europeans who borrowed Indian numbering from Arabs called it "Arabic". This historically wrong name has been retained to this day.</p>

      <p>Mohammed wrote his works in Arabic, which was an international scientific language in the East, as Latin was in Western Europe. From here, the Arabized name Al-Khwarizmi (or Al-Khwarizmi), by which Mohammed is known in history. This remarkable scientist is also the founder of algebra.</p>

      <p>Also borrowed from Arabic is the word "figure" (in Arabic "sypher"), meaning literally "blank space" (a translation of the Sanskrit word "sunya", which has the same meaning).</p>

      <p>This word was originally used to name the sign of the empty category and this meaning has been preserved as early as in the 18th century, although in the 15th century the Latin term "nullum" (<em>nullum</em> - nothing) appeared.</p>

      <p>The form of Indian numerals underwent many changes. The form in which we write them was established in the 16th century.</p>
