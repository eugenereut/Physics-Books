        <h2 class="blog-post-title mb-4">24. Basics principles of molecular-kinetic theory</h2>

        <p>Perhaps the most important thing that we have learned about the world around us is that all bodies are made up from very small particles that are in continuous motion. The particles are attracted to each other at short distances and are repulsed by close approaching.</p>

        <p>Molecular-kinetic theory of substance structure is based on three positions, each of which is now proved by experiment: <strong>the substance consists from particles; these particles move chaotically; the particles interact with each other.</strong></p>

        <p>The properties and behavior of bodies, ranging from rarefied gases from the upper atmosphere to solids on Earth, as well as super-dense nuclei of planets and stars, are ultimately determined by the movement of particles that interact with each other, from which consisted all bodies: molecules, atoms or even smaller formations - <em>elementary particles.</em></p>

        <p><strong>Proof of the existence of molecules. Estimated molecular size.</strong><br>The assumption that all bodies consist of separate particles, and, hence, no one body can be divided into as small parts as you like, was expressed by ancient thinkers Democritus and others 2500 years before our time. Qualitative explanation of many phenomena with the help of molecular theory was given in the XVIII century by Swiss mathematician and physicist <strong>Daniel Bernoulli</strong> in his book Hydrodynamica (1738). However, it was only the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century that the existence of molecules and atoms was indisputably proved. The thing is, the atoms are very small. They are not only invisible in the eye, but also in the microscope. That's why all the bodies seem solid to us.</p>

        <p>The first strict proof of the existence of atoms and molecules was obtained in chemistry. Now there are many proofs. To be sure of the existence of molecules, it is necessary to determine their size.<br> One of the simplest ways to estimate the size of molecules is as follows.<br> It is known that it is impossible to spray a drop of Olive oil with the volume of \(1 mm^3 \) on the surface of water more than \(0.6 \, m^2 \) area. It can be assumed that when the oil spreads over the maximum area, it forms a layer only in one molecule. The thickness of this layer is easy to calculate and estimate the size of the molecule of olive oil.<br>Let's cut a cube of \(1 \, mm^3 \) into square layers, \(1 \, mm^2 \) each, so that they could cover an area of \(0.6 \, m^2 \) (Fig. 17). The number of such layers will be</p>

        <p><h5 class="text-center">\(\frac{0.6 \, m^2}{0.000001 \, m^2} = 6 \times 10^5 \)</h5></p>

        <p>From here we obtain that the thickness of the oil layer, and therefore the particle size of Olive oil is</p>

        <p><h5 class="text-center">\(\frac{0.1 \, cm}{6 \cdot 10^5} \approx 1.7 \times 10^{-7} cm\)</h5></p>

        <p>With such small molecules, the number of them in any macroscopic body is enormous. Thus, there are about \(3 \times 10^{22} \) of them in a drop of water with the mass of \( 1g \). The body is called macroscopic if it consists of a very large number of molecules.</p>

        <p>The size of molecules is so small that an attempt to imagine these sizes clearly exceeds the possibilities of our imagination. What can the number \(2.3 \times 10^{-8} cm \) tell us - the approximate size of a hydrogen molecule? As always in such cases, comparisons help the imagination. If the pen you write with is magnified enough to take it out from Earth to the Moon, the diameter of the hydrogen molecule with the same magnification will be the size of the pen.</p>

        <p><strong>Movement of molecules.</strong> The most obvious proof of the movement of molecules can be obtained by observing the tiniest insoluble particles in the water in the microscope. These particles make a chaotic movement called Brownian motion as a result of countless irregular pushes of surrounding molecules. Later on we will learn more about Brownian motion.</p>

        <p>Proving the existence of significant forces of <strong>interaction between atoms or molecules</strong> is not difficult at all if you try to break a wooden stick. But it consists of molecules, so these forces help solid bodies to maintain the shape and volume.</p>

        <p><strong>Motion laws.</strong> The basic principles of molecular-kinetic theory, which were discussed, allow us to explain qualitatively the basic properties of bodies and features of heat phenomena. But to create a quantitative theory it is necessary to know the laws of molecular motion. We are familiar with the laws of Newton's mechanics. They describe the motion of bodies containing a large number of molecules - macroscopic bodies. It is not obvious in advance that the movement of individual molecules should obey the same laws.</p>

        <p>Suppose, however, that the motion of molecules is subject to the laws of Newton's mechanics. Where the consequences of the theory arising from this assumption do not contradict experiment, this assumption can be considered valid. It does prove to be true, but not in all cases.<br>
        For example, the motion of atoms or molecules in gases is subject to the laws of classical mechanics. However, the internal motion of particles in atoms cannot be described using the laws of Newton. Here it is necessary to use the laws of <em>Quantum mechanics</em>.</p>

        <p>The application of Newton's mechanical laws to describe the motion of atoms and molecules in liquids and solids depends on temperature. For example, at sufficiently high temperatures, the motion of solid body atoms relative to the nodes of the crystal structure is well described by the laws of Newton, and at low temperatures it is necessary to use Quantum mechanics</p>

        <p>Further on we will not try to build a quantitative molecular theory of solids and will limit ourselves to gases only. Therefore we can consider that motion of molecules is subject to the laws of Newton mechanics.</p>

        <h2 class="blog-post-title mb-4">25. Structure of gaseous, liquid and solid bodies</h2>

        <p>With the help of molecular-kinetic theory we can understand why bodies are capable of being in gaseous, liquid and solid states.</p>

        <p><strong>Gases.</strong> In gases, the distance between atoms or molecules is on average many times larger than the size of the molecules themselves (Fig. 1). For example, at atmospheric pressure, the volume of the gas vessel is hundreds of thousands of times greater than the total volume of molecules. Molecules with high velocities move in space. Faced with each other, they bounce back from each other in different directions like billiard balls. The faster the gas molecules move, the higher its temperature.</p>

        <p>Gases are easily compressed, as only the average distance between the molecules decreases when the gas is compressed, but the molecules do not squeeze each other (Fig. 2).<br>The weak attraction forces of molecules are not able to keep them close to each other. Therefore, gases can expand indefinitely. They do not only retain their shape as solids, but also their volume as liquids.<br>Countless hits of molecules against the vessel wall create gas pressure.</p>

        <div class="mx-auto d-block mb-4" style="width: 36rem;">
      		<img src="../common/img/book3-pic12.png" class="card-img-top" alt="...">
      	</div>

        <p><strong>Liquids.</strong> In liquids, the molecules are located almost closely together (Fig. 3). Therefore, each molecule behaves differently than in gas. Clamped as "in a cage" by other molecules, it "runs in place" (fluctuates near the balance position). Only from time to time, she makes a "jump", breaking through the "bars of the cage", but immediately gets into a new "cage" formed by the new neighbors. The time of "sedentary life" molecule of water at room temperature, for example, continues about one hundred millionth fraction of a second, and the time for which one oscillation is made, much less (\(10^{-12} - 10^{-13} seconds\)). As the temperature rises, the time of "sedentary life" decreases. The nature of the molecular motion in liquids makes it possible to understand the main features a liquid's activity.</p>

        <p>The liquid molecules are close together. Therefore, when trying to change the volume of the liquid, even a small value begins to deform the molecules themselves (Fig. 4). As a result, the liquid, unlike gas, is extremely difficult to compress. It is no more difficult to understand the reason for low compressibility of liquids than to understand why it is so difficult to squeeze into a crowded bus.</p>

        <p>It is also clear why liquids flow, in other words, they do not retain their shape. Under the influence of an external force (usually a force of attraction to the Earth or a force of pressure from a moving solid body), molecules jump from one "settled" position to another mainly in the direction of force. That is why the liquid flows and takes the form of a vessel (Fig. 5). The number of force jumps per second does not change significantly; it is determined by the intensity of the heat movement. For the flow of fluid it is necessary only that the time of action of force was many times longer than the time of "sedentary life" of the molecule. Otherwise, short-term force will only cause elastic deformation, and a drop of water will behave like a steel ball.</p>

        <p><strong>Solid bodies.</strong> Atoms or molecules of solids, unlike liquids, cannot break their bonds with their nearest neighbors and fluctuate around certain equilibrium positions. Sometimes molecules change the position of equilibrium, but it is extremely rare. That's why solid bodies retain not only volume but also shape.</p>

        <div class="mx-auto d-block mb-4" style="width: 36rem;">
      		<img src="../common/img/book3-pic13.png" class="card-img-top" alt="...">
      	</div>

        <p>There's another difference between liquid and solid bodies. Liquids can be compared to a crowd in which people are restlessly pushed on the spot, and solid bodies are usually like a slender cohort (military unit of a Roman legion), where people keep certain intervals between them on average. If we connect the centers of the equilibrium of atoms or molecules of the solid body, we get the correct spatial structure, called the crystal structure. The figures show the crystal structure of table salt (Fig. 6), diamond (Fig. 7) and magnesium (Fig. 8).</p>

        <p>If nothing prevents the crystal from growing, the internal order in the arrangement of atoms leads to geometrically correct external forms (Fig. 9).</p>

        <h2 class="blog-post-title mb-4">26. Systems with a large number of particles and the laws of mechanics</h2>

        <p>The properties of any body are determined by the properties and movement of the particles composing it. Let's consider, for example, how the pressure of gas arises on the walls of a vessel.</p>

        <p>Let the gas be in a closed vessel. The pressure meter shows a certain gas pressure \( p_0 \). But how does this pressure appear? If a molecule hits a wall, it will affect the wall with a certain amount of force for a short period of time. As a result of random impacts on the wall, the force acting from the molecules per unit of the wall area, i.e. the pressure, will change very quickly over time, approximately as shown in the graph. However, the actions caused by the impact of individual molecules, the meter is not recorded, because the molecules are very small. Therefore, the meter registers the average pressure \( p_0 \) acting on its membrane. It is also shown on the graph in blue line. Despite small changes in pressure, this average value \( p_0 \) is practically defined value because of the fact that there are a lot of impacts on the wall.</p>

          </svg>
        </div>

        <p>It is easy to explain why the gas is exerting pressure on the walls of the vessel. But calculating the average pressure is not that easy. After all, the pressure depends on the movement of all gas molecules, and the number of them is huge, and to determine the trajectories of all molecules is not possible.</p>

        <p>However, the task of researching systems of large numbers of particles on the basis of certain notions of the structure of the substance can be solved. The behavior of such systems as a whole reveals not so complex regularities. But these are laws of a new type, the laws of molecular-kinetic theory, or <em>statistical mechanics</em>.</p>

        <p>For describing the properties of macroscopic bodies and processes that we observe on experiment, it is not necessary to know the character of motion of individual particles. It is important to know not the behavior of individual molecules, but the average result to which their aggregate motion leads. This result can be predicted with the help of molecular-kinetic theory.</p>

      <h3 class="pb-4 mb-4 font-italic border-bottom">From the Molecular-kinetic theory of Ideal Gas</h3>

      <div class="blog-post">
        <h2 class="blog-post-title mb-4">27. Ideal gas in molecular-kinetic theory</h2>

        <p>The challenge of molecular-kinetic theory is to explain the properties of macroscopic bodies based on the laws of motion of the particles composing them. This challenge is quite complex. In this chapter we get to know the theory of the simplest system - <em>the ideal gas</em>.</p>

        <p>Let's assume that the gas is fairly sparse, so that the distance between gas molecules is many times greater than their size. Highly sparse gas is called ideal in molecular theory. In thermodynamics, we called ideal such a gas, the equation of state of which is the Clapeyron equation \((1-12)\). The new definition of ideal gas does not contradict the old one, because the molecular-kinetic theory of gas leads to the equation of state \((1-12)\).</p>

        <p>In the simplest model of gas molecules can be considered as very small solid elastic balls, the attraction forces between them are absent, and the repulsive forces appear only when the molecules collide directly with each other or with the molecules of the vessel walls. In such a model, the motion of gas molecules is subject to the laws of classical Newton mechanics.</p>

      </div><!-- /.blog-post -->

      <div class="blog-post">
        <h2 class="blog-post-title mb-4">28. Heat motion of gas molecules</h2>

        <p>From the very beginning, we must stop trying to track the motion of all the molecules that make up the gas. There are too many of them, and because of the collisions with each other the movement of molecules is very complicated. Instead, we will make a single, but very important assumption about the general nature of this motion.</p>

        <p><strong>Suppose the gas molecules move randomly.</strong> The speed of any molecule can be either very high or very low. The direction of movement of molecules changes chaotically when they collide with each other.</p>

        <p>However, even though the movement of individual molecules is chaotic, the behavior of all molecules as a whole reveals on average some simple trends. Firstly, if any direction \(x\) is randomly identified in gas, then the average number of molecules moving in this direction should be equal to the average number of molecules moving in the opposite direction. After all, the chaos in the movement of molecules means that none of the directions of motion is dominant. They are all equal.</p>

        <p>Similarly, the average number of people walking along a city street in one direction and another, for a fairly long period of time on average is equal. Of course, if we exclude special cases such as holiday demonstrations.</p>

        <p>Second, simple laws are valid for the average arithmetic speed of molecules. Let there be \(N\) molecules. Projections of the velocities of these molecules in the x direction can take all sorts of values: \(\upsilon_{x_1}, \upsilon_{x_2}, \upsilon_{x_3}, ..., \upsilon_{x_i}, ..., \upsilon_{x_N}\). And each projection can be either positive or negative. The average arithmetic value of the velocity projection is \(\vec{\upsilon_x}\), by this direction \(x\) is equal to the sum of the velocity projections of all molecules divided by their number</p>

        <p><h4 class="text-center">\( \overline{\upsilon_x} {~=~} \frac{\upsilon_{x_1}{~+~}\upsilon_{x_2}{~+~}\upsilon_{x_3}{~+~}...{~+~}\upsilon_{x_i}{~+~}...{~+~}\upsilon_{x_N}}{N} \) <span class="float-right">(3-1)</span></h4></p>

        <p>Similarly, it is possible to determine the average value of any value taking on different values, for example, the average height of a student in a class.
Because of the chaos in the movement of molecules, positive values of velocity projections should occur as often as negative values. Therefore, the average value of the velocity projection in any direction \(x\) is zero</p>

        <p><h5 class="text-center">\( \overline{\upsilon_x} {~=~} 0 \) <span class="float-right">(3-2)</span></h5></p>

        <p>But the average square of the velocity projection (we will see soon that this value is important), of course, is not equal to zero, because all the elements of the sum are positive</p>

        <p><h4 class="text-center">\( \overline\upsilon{^2_x} {~=~} \frac{\upsilon{^2_{x_1}} {~+~} \upsilon{^2_{x_2}} {~+~} \upsilon{^2_{x_3}} {~+~} ... {~+~} \upsilon{^2_{x_i}} {~+~} ... {~+~} \upsilon{^2_{x_N}}}{N} \) <span class="float-right">(3-3)</span></h4></p>

        <p>Due to the fact that the direction of \(x\) does not differ from the directions \(y\) and \(z\) (again, because of the chaos in the movement of molecules), the equations are fair</p>

        <p><h5 class="text-center">\(\overline\upsilon{^2_x} {~=~} \overline\upsilon{^2_y} {~=~} \overline\upsilon{^2_z}\) <span class="float-right">(3-4)</span></h5></p>

        <p>For each molecule, the square speed is equal: \(\upsilon{^2_i} {~=~} \upsilon{^2_{x_i}} {~+~} \upsilon{^2_{y_i}} {~+~} \upsilon{^2_{z_i}}\). The value of the average square of velocity, determined in the same way as the average square of the velocity projection ( equation 3-3), is equal to the sum of the average squares of its projections</p>

        <p><h5 class="text-center">\(\overline\upsilon^2 {~=~} \overline\upsilon{^2_x} {~+~} \overline\upsilon{^2_y} {~+~} \overline\upsilon{^2_z}\)<span class="float-right">(3-5)</span></h5></p>

        <p>From equations \((3-4)\) and \((3-5)\) it follows that</p>

        <p><h5 class="text-center">\(\overline\upsilon{^2_x} {~=~} \overline\upsilon{^2_y} {~=~} \overline\upsilon{^2_z} {~=~} \frac{1}{3}\overline\upsilon^2 \)<span class="float-right">(3-6)</span></h5></p>

        <p><em>The assumption made by us about the chaotic character of gas molecules motion,</em> from which equations (3-2) and (3-4) follow, <em>is performed better than more collisions between molecules.</em></p>

      <div class="blog-post">
        <h2 class="blog-post-title mb-4">29. Basic equation of molecular-kinetic theory of gases</h2>

        <p>Lets find the dependence of the average gas pressure on the walls of the vessel on the average speed of its molecules.<br>
Let the gas be in a rectangular vessel with solid walls of volume \(V\) (Fig. 1). Moreover, the gas and the vessel have the same temperature, i.e. are in thermal equilibrium.</p>

        <p>Gas molecules collide with the walls of a vessel. Each time a molecule hits the wall, the molecule briefly interacts with the wall. We will consider the collisions of molecules with the walls to be absolutely elastic and calculate the impulse of force acting on the \(CD\) wall by the impact of one molecule. For this purpose we use the second Newton law.</p>

        <p>The wall is the ideal reflector for an absolutely elastic impact. On the side of the wall, a force perpendicular to the wall acts on the molecule. A particle flying at a certain speed against the wall will fly away at the same speed after the collision. And if the projection of speed in the direction \(x\) is \(+\upsilon_x\) when moving towards the wall, then after reflection from the wall it will be \(-\upsilon_x\). Projections \(\upsilon_y\) and \(\upsilon_x\), on the other hand, do not change in value by elastic impact (Fig. 2). (Here \(\upsilon_x, \, \upsilon_y, \, \upsilon_z\) are the absolute values of the velocity projections.)</p>

        <p>Let's denote the mass of the molecule \(m\), and the impact time (it is very short) \(\delta{t}\). Then, according to the second Newton law, the impulse of force \(f'\delta{t}\) acting on the molecule is equal to the difference between the projections of the molecule momentum on the \(x-axis\) after the collision (\(-m\upsilon_x\)) and before the collision (\(+m\upsilon_x\))</p>

        <p><h5 class="text-center">\(f'\delta{t} {~=~} (-m\upsilon_x) {~-~} (+m\upsilon_x) {~=~} -2m\upsilon_x \)</h5></p>

        <p>According to the third Newton's law, from the side of the molecule on the wall will act force \(f\), the impulse of which is equal to</p>

        <p><h5 class="text-center">\(f\delta{t} {~=~} 2m\upsilon_x \)</h5></p>

        <p>But we are not interested in the force acting on the wall by the impact of one molecule, but the average on time the force value, which is caused by the impact on the wall of all molecules in the time interval \( \Delta{t} {~\gg~} \delta{t} \). During this time, the wall will reach only those molecules that are at a distance not exceeding \( \upsilon_x\Delta{t} \) (Fig. 3). Otherwise, the molecules simply do not reach the wall in time. It should also be assumed that the \(CD\) walls will reach only those molecules with \( \upsilon_x \, > \, 0  \), i.e. moving from left to right.<br><small>(Thank you friendsThe interval \(\Delta{t}\) can be considered quite small, so that there are practically no collisions of molecules in the \( \upsilon_x\Delta{t} \) layer, even though the number of molecules is high. This is possible because the average distance between the molecules is much less than the average free path of the molecules, i.e. the average distance between the molecules without collisions.)</small></p>

      	</div>

        <p>Do not think that the values of the velocity projections \( \upsilon_y \), and \( \upsilon_z \), somehow affect in achieving the molecules on the \(CD\) wall. If the molecule collides with the wall \(BC\) or \(AD\) (Fig. 3), the projection of the velocity \( \upsilon_x \) will not change and the molecule will still move along the axis \(x\) to the segment \( \upsilon_x\Delta{t} \).</p>

        <p>The number of molecules \(n'\) in the allocated volume of \(CC'DD'\) is equal to</p>

        <p><h5 class="text-center">\(n' {~=~} nS \upsilon_x \Delta t \)</h5></p>

        <p>where<br>
          \(S\) is the CD wall area;<br>
          \(n {~=~} \frac{N}{V} \) average number of molecules per volume unit (concentration of molecules).</p>

        <p>But only half the molecules are moving towards the wall of the \(CD\). Therefore, the number of hits of \(Z\) molecules against the wall of the vessel during the time \(\Delta t \) will be equal to</p>

        <p><h5 class="text-center">\(Z {~=~} \frac{n}{2} S \upsilon_x \Delta t \)</h5></p>

        <p>Each molecule gives a \(2m \upsilon_x \) impulse to the wall, and therefore during the time \(\Delta t\) the wall will receive impulse</p>

        <p><h5 class="text-center">\( F \Delta{t} {~=~} Z\cdot2m\upsilon_x {~=~} nmS \upsilon{^2_x} \Delta{t} \)</h5></p>

        <p>Now we have to consider that not all molecules have the same speed \(\upsilon_x\). The impulse of <strong>average force</strong> \({\overline F}\Delta{t}\) is defined by the average square of the velocity projection \(\upsilon{^2_x}\)</p>

        <p><h5 class="text-center">\( {\overline{F}}\Delta{t} {~=~} nmS \overline\upsilon{^2_x} \Delta{t} \)<span class="float-right">(3-7)</span></h5></p>

        <p>Now let's use the equation \((3-6)\) to enter the average square of velocity \(\overline\upsilon^2 \). Then, dividing (3-7) into \(S\Delta{t}\) we get</p>

        <p><h5 class="text-center">\(p {~=~} \frac{\Large\overline{F}}{S} {~=~} \frac{1}{3} mn \overline\upsilon^2 \)<span class="float-right">(3-8)</span></h5></p>

        <p>This is the basic equation of molecular-kinetic theory of gases.<br>

        <p>Let now turn to the most important consequences arising from the basic equation of molecular-kinetic theory of gases. It can be used to establish that temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the chaotic movement of molecules.</p>

        <p>We found a connection between two thermodynamic parameters of pressure \(p\) and volume \(V\) with the average kinetic energy of the translational motion of molecules.</p>

        <p><strong>The average kinetic energy of the chaotic movement of gas molecules is proportional to the absolute temperature.</strong> The faster the molecules move, then the higher the temperature. This opens up a deep physical meaning of the concept of temperature.</p>

        <p>The connection between temperature and average kinetic energy of molecules \((3-11)\) is established by us for rarefied gases. However it appears fair for any substances, movement of atoms or molecules which submits to laws of classical mechanics of Newton. This connection is true for liquids and solids, in which atoms can only oscillate near the positions of equilibrium in the nodes of the crystal lattice. It follows that if the gas and the walls of the vessel have the same temperature, then the average kinetic energy of the atoms of gas and the wall are the same.</p>

        <p>At very low temperatures, the model of ideal gas becomes unacceptable, the motion of atoms does not obey the laws of classical mechanics and the ratio \((3-11)\) is no longer applied. The relationship between temperature and average kinetic energy is more complex.</p>

        <p>When these numbers were first obtained (second half of the 20th century), many physicists were literally stunned. Calculated gas molecule velocities were higher than artillery bullets! Therefore, there were doubts about the fairness of the kinetic theory. After all, it is well known that the smell, for example, in the gas spread quite slowly, it takes about tens of seconds for the smell of perfume spilled in one corner of the room spread to another angle.<br>However, this contradiction can be easily resolved. It is necessary to consider the collisions of molecules, because of which the trajectory of each molecule is a very tangled broken line (Fig. 1). The molecule has high velocities in straight sections of broken line. Moving of the molecule is not significant on average, even during the time of the order of minutes, because the rectilinear parts of the trajectory are very small (about \(10^{-4} ~sm\) at atmospheric pressure). Experiments to determine the velocities of molecules proved the validity of the equation \((3-13)\).</p>

        <p>An elegant method of determining the velocities of atoms was proposed by Otto Stern in 1920. The device consists of two concentric cylinders \(A\) and \(B\), firmly connected with each other (Fig. 2-a). Cylinders can rotate at a constant angular velocity. Along the axis of the small cylinder there is a thin platinum wire \(C\), covered with a layer of silver. High electric current is passed through it. There is a narrow slot \(O\) in the wall of this cylinder. Cylinder \(B\) is located at room temperature.</p>

        <p>At first, the device is not moving. When electric current flows along the wire, the silver layer evaporates and the inner cylinder is filled with gas from silver atoms. Some atoms fly through the slot \(O\) and, having reached the inner surface of cylinder \(B\), settle on it. As a result, a narrow strip of silver \(D\) is formed directly against the slot (Fig. 2-b). Then the cylinders are driven into rotation at a speed of \(~\omega\). Now for the time required by the atom to pass the path equal to the difference in radius of the cylinders \(R_b-R_a\), the cylinders will rotate at some angle \(~\phi\). As a result, atoms will fall on the inner surface of the large cylinder not directly against the slot \(O\), but at some distance \(S\) from the end of the radius passing through the middle of the slot (Fig. 3). After all, they move straight ahead. This distance \(S\) is equal to

        <p>The easiest ideal gas in terms of its properties, consisting not of molecules, but of single atoms. Such a gas is called a monatomic or single atomic. This term implies that the "molecule" of gas consists of one atom. Helium, neon, argon are monatomic inert gases.</p>

        <p>Ideal gas molecules do not interact with each other, except in cases of direct collision. Therefore, their average potential energy of interaction is very small and all internal energy represents the kinetic energy of chaotic movement of molecules.<br>Since the average kinetic energy of a molecule at translational motion is determined by equation \((3-12)\), the average kinetic energy for one mole is equal to</p>

        <p><h5 class="text-center">\(U ~= ~N_A\frac{3}{2}kT ~= ~\frac{3}{2}RT \)<span class="float-right">(3-14)</span></h5>This equation defines the internal energy of an ideal single atomic gas.</p>

        <p>When writing down the equation \((3-14)\), it was assumed that the container of gas rested, i.e. the velocity of the center of gravity of the gas is equal to zero. Therefore, the internal energy is the average kinetic energy of molecules movement relative to the center of gravity. This was already mentioned in <a href="../chapter1/book3-16.html" class="text-muted">\(\S16\)</a>. If the center of gravity of the gas moves at the speed of \(~\upsilon_0\), the total energy of one mole of gas is equal to the sum of mechanical (kinetic) energy \(~\frac{\mu\upsilon{^2_0}}{2}\) and internal energy \(U\)</p>

        <p><h5 class="text-center">\(\overline{E} ~= ~\frac{\mu\upsilon{^2_0}}{2} + \frac{3}{2}RT \)</h5></p>

        <p>The internal energy of an ideal gas consisting of more complex molecules is also proportional to the absolute temperature. But the proportionality coefficient between \(U\) and \(T\) is different.</p>

        <p>Now let's discuss the difference between isothermal and adiabatic processes.</p>

        <p>We will use two cylinders filled with gas. In the initial position \(1\) the volumes and temperatures of gas in the cylinders are the same. Then the gas expands. In the first cylinder, expansion occurs at a constant temperature - isothermally. The second cylinder is thermally insulated, so it has an adiabatic process.<br>In the isothermal process, the temperature and therefore the internal energy do not change. The pressure at expansion decreases by the Law of Boyle-Mariotte (Fig. 1).</p>

        <div class="mx-auto d-block mt-4 mb-4 text-center">

        <p>At expansion of gas in the thermally insulated \((\Delta{Q}=0)\) cylinder work is performed by internal energy of gas, so the internal energy is reduced. On the basis of equation \((3-14)\) we conclude that the temperature decreases as well.</p>

        <p>Thus, with adiabatic expansion, the gas is cooled down. The pressure drops faster than with isothermal expansion (Fig. 1).<br>With adiabatic compression, work is done to increase the internal energy. Therefore, the temperature rises and the pressure rises faster than with isothermal compression (Fig. 1).</p>

        <h2 class="blog-post-title mb-4">35. Brownian motion</h2>

        <p>The most convincing and visual proof of the fairness of molecular-kinetic theory was obtained in the study of Brownian motion. We have already mentioned it. The phenomenon of Brownian motion gives a rough, highly simplified, but deeply correct representation of the heat motion of molecules.</p>

        <p>Its principle can be understood from the following simple example. Let's say two teams play soccer. But unlike ordinary soccer, there are not 11 players in the team, but a lot of them, so they fill almost the entire field. We are watching the field from such a distance that the eyes cannot distinguish between the individual running players. Under these conditions, instead of individual players on the field we will see a homogeneous surface. We could see more when playing not with a regular soccer ball, but with a large (three meters in diameter) lightweight ball. The ball will make random movements, as it is struck and pushed in different directions by players of fighting teams. The motion of the ball gives us a very simplified, rough picture of the continuous movement of players.</p>

        <p>Similar actions are taken when observing Brownian motion. Only to help the eye take a microscope. A drop of liquid, to which added a small insoluble powder, is placed under the microscope lens. The English botanist Brown, who first observed this phenomenon in 1827, used the pollen grains. Nowadays, it is common to take paint particles of gummigut that are insoluble in water. These particles are constantly making a chaotic movement, which never stops. Its intensity increases with increasing temperature. Figure 1 shows the pattern of motion of the Brownian particle. Positions of the particle marked by dots are determined at regular intervals. These points are connected by straight lines. In fact, the particle trajectories between two successive collisions are much more complex.</p>

        <div class="mx-auto d-block mt-4 mb-4 text-center">
      		<img src="../common/img/book3-pic18.png" class="img-fluid" alt="...">
      	</div>

        <p>Brownian motion can be seen in the gas as well. It is made by particles of dust or smoke suspended in the air.<br>The Brownian motion can be explained only on the basis of molecular-kinetic theory. The reason for the Brownian motion of a particle is that the strikes of a molecule against it do not compensate each other. Figure 2 schematically shows the position of one Brownian particle and its nearest molecules. Due to the chaotic movement of molecules, the momentum they transmit to the Brownian particle, for example, left and right, is not uniform. Therefore, the resulting pressure force is different from zero, which causes a change in the motion of the Brownian particle.</p>

        <p>Average pressure has a certain value in both gas and liquid. But there are always minor random deviations from the average. The smaller the area of the body, the more significant these deviations of the pressure force acting on this area are. Thus, if the site has the size of several diameters of a molecule, the force acting on it changes in a jump from zero to some final value when a molecule enters this site.</p>

        <p>The German physicist R. Paul colorfully describes the Brownian motion. Few phenomena are as fascinating to the observer as the Brownian motion. Here the observer is able to look behind the scenes of the nature. A new world opens up before him - the unstoppable hustle and bustle of a huge number of particles. The tiny particles quickly fly through the microscope, almost instantly changing the direction of motion. Larger particles are moving slowly, but they are constantly changing the direction of travel. Larger particles are practically pushed on the spot. Their protrusions clearly show the rotation of the particles around the axis, which constantly changes the direction in space. There is no sign of system or order anywhere. The dominance of blind chance is what a strong, overwhelming impression this picture has on the observer. No verbal description can even approximately replace one's own observation.</p>

        <p>The Brownian Molecular Kinetic Theory was built by Albert Einstein in 1905. This theory was finally completed by the victory of the molecular-kinetic theory of substance structure. It was proved that Brownian particles participate in the heat motion of the environment: liquid or gas molecules. This proved the existence of molecules.</p>

        <p>According to the equation \((3-12)\), the average kinetic energy of a particle's translational motion does not depend on its mass. In the case of a mixture of two gases, the average kinetic energy of each gas molecule is also determined by the equation \((3-12)\). If this were not the case, the temperatures of the gases would be different in the state of thermodynamic equilibrium, which is impossible.</p>

        <p>The aggregate of Brownian particles can be considered as a gas, and, therefore, the average kinetic energy of the particle's translational motion is equal to</p>

        <p><h5 class="text-center">\(\frac{\overline{M\upsilon^2}}{2} ~= ~\frac{3}{2}kT \)</h5></p>

        <p>This equation explains why the intensity of Brownian motion increases with temperature and decreases with increasing particle mass. Because</p>

        <p><h5 class="text-center">\(\overline{\upsilon^2} ~= ~\frac{3kT}{M} \)</h5></p>

        <p><small>It should be said that it is complicated to measure experimentally the speed of the Brownian particle because of extreme irregularity of the Brownian motion.</small></p>

        <p>If the mass of a particle is large, the average velocity of its motion will be so low that the particle's motion is almost impossible to detect.</p>

        <p>The Brownian motion has practical meaning. Irregular oscillations of the arrows of sensitive analogue measuring instruments (Cavendish torsion balance for measuring the gravitational constant or high-sensitivity galvanometers) also represent Brownian motion. This imposes restrictions on the ability to increase the sensitivity of all measuring instruments at room temperatures. Only deep cooling makes it possible to increase the accuracy of measurements.</p>

      <div class="blog-post">
        <h2 class="blog-post-title mb-4">36. The interaction forces of molecules</h2>

        <p>Ideal gas molecules are not attracted to each other. That is why the ideal gas does not turn into a liquid at any temperature. The formation of liquid or solid bodies is obviously only possible through the attraction of molecules. Otherwise, the molecules would spread out in all directions. In order to understand why real gas turns into liquid or solid body during cooling, it is necessary to get to know the interaction of molecules (or atoms) in more detail.</p>

        <p>A molecule is a complex system consisting of individual charged particles: electrons and atomic nuclei. Although in general molecules are electrically neutral, significant electrical forces act between them at short distances. There is an interaction between electrons and nuclei of neighboring molecules. Description of the motion of particles inside atoms and molecules and the forces of interaction between molecules is a very complex task. It is considered in atomic physics and solved with the help of quantum mechanics. We will only give the final result: an approximate dependence of the interaction force of two molecules on the distance between them.</p>

        <p>This force is quite complex to change as the distance changes. At distances several times greater than the size of the molecules, there is a force of attraction between them. These forces increase as the molecules approach. But at very short distances the attraction forces begin to decrease, and when the molecules come close to each other, repulsive forces arise between them. Without repulsive forces at very short distances, the substance could not exist. The molecules would penetrate into each other and the entire piece of matter would shrink to the volume of one molecule.</p>

        <p>Figure 1 shows an approximate relationship between the interaction force of the two molecules and the distance between them. Negative force values correspond to the attraction and positive force values to repulsion. At a distance \(r_0\) equal to approximately the sum of the molecule radii, the interaction force is zero. With \(r \rightarrow \infty ~F \rightarrow 0\), and with \(r \rightarrow 0 ~F \rightarrow \infty\).</p>

        <div class="mx-auto d-block mt-4 mb-4 text-center">
      		<img src="../common/img/book3-pic19.png" class="img-fluid" alt="...">
      	</div>

        <p>The dependence of the interaction forces of molecules on the distance between them explains the appearance of elasticity forces in the compression and tension of bodies. If we try to bring the molecules closer to each other by a distance smaller than \(r_0\), there will be a force preventing them from coming closer. On the contrary, when the molecules are separated from each other, there is a force of attraction, which returns the molecules to their original positions after the end of the external influence.</p>

        <p>When molecules are displaced slightly from the equilibrium position the attraction or repulsion force grows linearly with increasing displacement. In a small segment, the curve can be considered as a straight segment (the thickened section of the curve in Fig. 1). That is why Hooke's law, according to which the elastic force is proportional to the amount of deformation, is true for small deformations. At large displacements of molecules Hooke's law is already unfair.</p>

        <p>Since the deformation of the body changes the distances between all molecules, the neighboring layers of molecules have a small part of the total deformation. Therefore, Hooke's law is applied at deformations millions of times larger than the size of the molecules.</p>

        <h2 class="blog-post-title mb-4">37. Potential energy of interaction between two molecules</h2>

        <p>Introduction to the interaction of molecules began with a review of forces. However, it is more important to know not the forces, but the potential energy of molecular interaction. In the case of a large number of molecules (and in a macroscopic body this number is huge) the main role is played the energy. It is possible to speak, about average energy of molecules of substance (it is internal energy), but to speak about average force of interaction does not make sense. Forces between separate pairs of particles are equal in quantity, and are directed to each other. Therefore, the total sum of forces acting inside any body is equal to zero at all. We can only speak about the average force with which the system (for instance, gas in a cylinder) acts on the outer body (for example, on the walls of a cylinder).</p>

        <p>By knowing the dependence of force on distance, it is possible to determine the exact dependence on distance the potential energy. But it is enough for us to know only approximately the type of potential curve \(U(r)\). First of all, let's remember that the potential energy is determined with an accuracy to an arbitrary constant, because it is not the potential energy itself that makes sense, but the difference of potential energies in two points, equal to the work taken with the opposite sign. Let's consider, as it is accepted in physics, that \(~U = 0\) at \(r \rightarrow \infty\). The potential energy of the system can be considered as the value of the work that the system can do. And the potential energy is determined by the location of bodies, but not by their velocities. The greater the distance between the molecules, the more work will be done by the attraction forces between them at their approach. Therefore, with decreasing \(r\), starting from the initial large values, the potential energy will decrease. At \(r ~\rightarrow ~\infty\) the potential energy is equal to zero. That is why at decreasing \(r\) the potential energy becomes negative (Fig. 2).
        </p>

        <div class="mx-auto d-block mt-4 mb-4 text-center">

      	</div>

        <p>In the point \(r = r_0\) the force is equal to zero (Fig. 1). Therefore, if the molecules are located at this distance, they will rest. And the system cannot perform any work. It means that at \(r = r_0\) the potential energy has a minimum. We could take this value of potential energy \(-U_0\) as the initial value of potential energy. Then it would be positive everywhere (Fig. 3). Both curves (Figs. 2 and 3) equally characterize the interaction of molecules. The difference of \(U\) values in two points is the same for both curves, and only this difference makes sense.</p>

        <p>At \(r < r_0\), rapidly growing repulsive forces appear. They can also perform work. Therefore, the potential energy is growing as the molecules come closer together. And it grows very fast.</p>

        <p>Knowledge about the dependence of the potential energy interactions of molecules from the distance between them allows us to establish quantitative differences between gases, liquids and solids in terms of molecular-kinetic theory. <strong>In gases, the average kinetic energy of molecules is greater than the absolute value of the average potential energy.</strong> That is why the attraction forces cannot hold the gas molecules against each other. <strong>In liquids, the average kinetic energy of molecules is less than the absolute value of the average potential energy, and in solids it is much less.</strong></p>

        <h2 class="blog-post-title mb-4">38. Evaporation of liquids</h2>

        <p>A well-closed ink jar can stay in the storage cabinet for an extremely long time and the amount of ink in it does not change. If the jar is left open, we can see that there is no liquid in it after a long time. The water in which the ink dye is dissolved has evaporated. A puddle on the asphalt dries much faster, especially if the air temperature is high and the wind blows.</p>

        <p>This phenomenon is explained by the molecular-kinetic theory. Liquid molecules are involved in chaotic movement. At the same time, the higher the temperature of the liquid, the more intensive the molecules move, the greater their kinetic energy. But only the average value of the kinetic energy molecule has a certain quantity at a given temperature. At the moment each molecule may have either less or more energy than the average. Kinetic energy of some molecules may be so large that they are able to fly out of the liquid, overcoming the attraction forces of other molecules. This is the process of evaporation.</p>

        <p>A flying molecule takes part in the chaotic heat movement of gas. By moving randomly, it can move away from the liquid surface in an open container forever. But it can also return to the liquid again.</p>

        <p>If the air flow above the container carries away the liquid vapor, the liquid evaporates faster because the ability a vapour molecule to return to the liquid decreases.</p>

        <p>The higher the temperature of the liquid, the more molecules have enough kinetic energy to escape from the liquid, the faster the evaporation takes place.</p>

        <p>At evaporation the liquid escapes faster molecules. Therefore, the average kinetic energy of liquid molecules decreases. This means that the temperature of the liquid drops. Wetting your hand with some rapidly evaporating liquid (ether or acetone), you will immediately feel a strong cooling in the wetted area. Cooling will intensify if you blow on the wetted area. The same can be observed if you wet your finger with water, but the effect is less noticeable. However, you can use your finger to more precisely determine the direction of a very weak wind when it is difficult to immediately understand where it is blowing from. To do this, the finger wetted with water should be raised upwards. Cooling will be greatest from the side from which the wind blows.</p>

        <p>If the liquid cannot evaporate, it will cool down much more slowly. Remember how long the fat soup cools down. A layer of fat on the surface of the soup prevents fast water molecules escaping. The liquid does not evaporate much, and its temperature drops slowly (the fat itself evaporates very slowly, as its larger molecules are more firmly bound to each other than water molecules).</p>

        <h2 class="blog-post-title mb-4">39. Specific heat of vaporization</h2>

        <p>To keep the temperature of the evaporating liquid constant, it is necessary to bring heat to it. Of course, the heat itself can also be transmitted from surrounding bodies. For example, the water in the glass evaporates, but the temperature of the water, which is slightly lower than the ambient temperature (Fig. 1), remains constant. Heat is transferred from the air to the water until all the water has evaporated.</p>

        <p><strong>The quantity of heat required to convert a liquid into vapour at a constant temperature related to a unit of mass \((1kg~\) or \(~1g)\) is called the specific heat of vaporization.</strong></p>

        <p>What does this heat take up? First of all, to work against the attraction forces between the molecules when individual molecules leave the liquid (output work). In other words, heat is used to increase the potential energy of the molecules when they leave the liquid.</p>

        <p>Another part of the vaporization heat is used to work against external pressure forces when the volume of the substance increases. The volume of vapour is greater than the volume of liquid it is formed from. Evaporation is accompanied by an increase in the volume of the substance. This part of the evaporation heat is usually a few percent from the total at room temperature.</p>

        <p>As the temperature rises, the specific heat of vaporization decreases, because as the temperature rises, the kinetic energy molecules increase. Therefore, the bonding forces (molecular attraction forces) are already struggling to hold fast-moving liquid molecules against each other. To break the bond of one of the molecules with the rest of the liquid, less additional energy is enough.</p>

        <p>For example, the specific heat vaporization of water changes with increasing temperature as follows<br>
        with \(0^0C ~- 595 ~cal/g\)<br>
        with \(50^0C ~- 568 ~cal/g\)<br>
        with \(100^0C ~- 539 ~cal/g\)<br>
        with \(200^0C ~- 468 ~cal/g\)<br>

        <h2 class="blog-post-title mb-4">40. Equilibrium between liquid and vapour</h2>

        <p>The quantity of water in the open container is continuously reduced by evaporation. But if the container is closed tightly, this does not happen. At a constant temperature, the system will be in a state of thermal equilibrium and will remain in it for as long as necessary. How does this work? After all, fast molecules will still fly out of the liquid and move to the area occupied by vapour.</p>

        <p>Here's the thing. At the first moment, after we pour the liquid and close the container, the liquid will evaporate and the density of vapour over the liquid will increase. At the same time, however, the number of molecules returning to the liquid as a result of chaotic thermal movement will increase. This process of turning vapour into a liquid, the reverse of the evaporation process, is called <em>condensation</em>. The higher the density of vapour, the more molecules it returns to the liquid. The picture is different in an open container. Molecules that have left the liquid may not return to the liquid.</p>

        <p>As a result, a state of equilibrium will eventually be established in a closed container. The number of molecules leaving the liquid surface will be equal to the number of vapour molecules returning to the liquid at the same time. The balance is dynamic in nature. Simultaneously with the evaporation process, condensation occurs and both processes on average compensate each other.</p>

        <p>Vapour in equilibrium with its liquid is called <em>saturated vapour</em>. If the air from the liquid container is pumped out, there will be nothing but saturated vapour above the liquid surface.</p>

      <div class="blog-post">
        <h2 class="blog-post-title mb-4">41. Boiling</h2>

        <p>As the temperature of the liquid increases, the evaporation rate increases. Finally, at a certain temperature, the liquid begins to boil. When boiling, inside the liquid a vapour bubbles appear throughout the entire volume, floating upwards. The liquid temperature at boiling point remains constant. A thermometer placed in boiling water will show approximately \(100^0C\), even though the heat is continuously supplied to the water. <strong>The temperature at which the liquid boils is called the boiling temperature.</strong></p>

        <p>Find out the conditions under which the liquid begins to boil. There are always dissolved gases in the liquid, which are released in the form of small bubbles on the bottom and walls of the container and on the suspended in the liquid dust. Liquid vapours, which are also present inside the bubbles, are saturated. As the temperature increases, the pressure of saturated vapours in the liquid increases and the bubbles increase in size. Under the influence of the ejection force, they float upwards. If the upper layers of the liquid have a lower temperature, the vapour in the bubbles condenses in these layers. The pressure drops rapidly and the bubbles collapse. The process of collapsing is so fast that the bubble walls collide and produce something like a small explosion. Many of these micro-explosions create an unique noise. When the liquid warms up enough, the bubbles stop collapsing and float to the surface. The liquid boils. Observe the kettle on the stove carefully. You will immediately find that it stops making noise before boiling.
        </p>

        <p>Obviously, a vapour bubble can only grow when the pressure of the saturated vapour inside is greater than the external pressure. <strong>Boiling starts at a temperature at which the pressure of saturated vapour in the bubbles is compared to the external pressure.</strong> Therefore, the boiling of a liquid is a process of evaporation that takes place not only from the surface of the liquid, but also inside the bubbles throughout the liquid.</p>

        <p>The higher the external pressure, the higher the boiling temperature. For example, at the pressure in the steam boiler, which reaches 16 atmosphere, the water does not boil at the temperature of \(200^0C\). In medical facilities, boiling water in hermetically closed containers also occurs at high pressure. Therefore, the boiling temperature is much higher than \(100^0C\). It allows to kill all microbes.</p>

        <p>On the contrary, by reducing the pressure, we reduce the boiling temperature. Under the air pump bell, water can be forced to boil at room temperature. Atmospheric pressure decreases when climbing into the mountains. Therefore, the boiling temperature decreases. At the height of \(7134 ~m\) the pressure is approximately equal to \(300 ~mm ~Hg\) (millimetre of mercury). The boiling temperature of water is about \(70^0C\). For example, meat cannot be boiled under these conditions.</p>

        <p>The difference in boiling temperatures of different liquids is determined by the difference in pressure of their saturated vapours at the same temperature. The higher the pressure of saturated vapour, the lower the boiling temperature of the corresponding liquid. Thus, at \(100^0C\) the pressure of saturated vapor of water is equal to \(760 ~mm ~Hg\), and mercury is only \(0.88 ~mm ~Hg\). Mercury boils at \(357^0C\) if the external pressure is equal to one atmosphere.</p>

        <p>The table shows the heat of vaporization of some liquids at boiling temperatures at normal atmospheric pressure. The heat of water vaporization is particularly high, as can be seen from the table.
          <table class="table">

        <p>Liquid can also exist at temperatures above boiling point. This liquid is called <em>overheated</em>. For this purpose, the liquid must be thoroughly cleaned beforehand and free from gas. In such a liquid, there are almost no vaporization centers - the tiniest air bubbles, which are germs of vapor bubbles.</p>

        <p>The overheated liquid is in an unstable state. It is enough to add, for example, chalk powder containing a large amount of air in its pores, as the liquid boils so rapidly that it partially spills out of the container. The temperature of the liquid drops to a boiling point, as the conversion of the liquid into vapour requires heat.</p>

        <h2 class="blog-post-title mb-4">42. Real gas isotherms</h2>

        <p>In order to establish in more detail the conditions under which mutual conversions of gas and liquid are possible, it is not enough to simply observe the evaporation or boiling of the liquid. Changes in the pressure and volume of real gas at different temperatures must be carefully monitored.</p>

        <p>We will slowly compress the gas, for instance carbon dioxide, under the piston in cylinder (Fig. 1). By compressing the gas, we are performing work on it, so that the internal energy of the gas must increase. If the process is to be carried out at a constant temperature of \(T\), a good heat exchange between the cylinder and the environment must be ensured. For this purpose, the cylinder can be placed in a large container with a liquid at a constant temperature and the gas can be compressed so slowly that the heat can be transferred from the gas to the surrounding bodies.</p>

        <p>Based on this experiment, it can be seen that, firstly, if the volume is large, the pressure with decreasing volume increases in accordance with the Boyle-Marriott law, and then, with the further increase in pressure, there are slight deviations from this law. Finally, starting with a certain value, the pressure does not change, despite the decrease in volume. If you look into the cylinder through a special viewing window, you can see transparent droplets on the walls of the cylinder and piston. This means that the gas has begun to condense, in other words, to become liquid.</p>

        <div class="mx-auto d-block mt-4 mb-4 text-center">
      		<img src="../common/img/book3-pic22.png" class="img-fluid" alt="...">
      	</div>

        <p>By continuing to compress the cylinder contents, we will only increase the mass of the fluid under the piston and thus reduce the mass of the gas. The pressure shown by the pressure gauge will remain constant until the entire space under the piston is filled with liquid. Liquids are not compressible enough. Therefore, with further a slight decrease in volume does pressure increases very rapidly.</p>

        <p>Since the whole process happens at a constant temperature \(T\), the curve showing the dependence of the pressure \(p\) on the volume \(V\) is called <em>isotherm</em> (Fig. 2). With the volume \(V_1\), gas condensation begins and with the volume \(V_2\), it ends. If \(V>V_1\), the substance is in a gaseous state, and at \(V < V2\) - in a liquid state.</p>

        <p>Experiments show that all other gases have the same kind of isotherms, if their temperature is not too high.</p>

        <p>The most remarkable thing about this process is the constant gas pressure when the volume changes from \(V_1\) to \(V_2\), when the gas is converted into a liquid. Each point in the straight section of the isotherm section \(1-2\) corresponds to the equilibrium between gaseous and liquid states of the substance. This means that the amount of liquid and gas above it remains constant at certain \(T\) and \(V\). As we already know, the equilibrium is dynamic: the number of molecules leaving the liquid is, on average, equal to the number of molecules passing from gas to liquid at the same time.</p>

        <p><strong>Constant pressure p, at which the liquid is in equilibrium with its gas, called the pressure of saturated vapour,</strong> and the gas itself, as previously mentioned, is called saturated vapour.</p>

        <p>The independence of \(p_0\) from the volume is explained by the fact that as the volume of vapour decreases, most of it becomes liquid. And this mass of liquid is smaller than the same mass of gas. When the vapour is compressed over the liquid, the equilibrium is disturbed. The density of vapour at the first moment increases slightly and more molecules are transferred from gas to liquid than from liquid to gas. This continues until the equilibrium is re-established and the density and pressure are restored to their previous values.<a name="pic23"></a></p>

        <p>So far, we've only looked at one specific isotherm of real gas. Now let's see how carbon dioxide will behave at a different, higher (but also constant) temperature of \(T_1\). The new isotherm, like the old one, is pretty much the same as the isotherm of ideal gas at high volumes. Starting with a certain volume of \(V'_1 < V_1\), it also goes horizontally (Fig. 3). Finally, with a volume of \(V'_2 > V_2\), the isotherm goes steeply upwards. This means that with the volume of \(V'_2\) the whole cylinder is filled with liquid.</p>

        <p>If several isotherms of real gas are constructed on the basis of experimental data (Fig. 3), a pattern common to all substances will be found. First, the higher the temperature, the lower the volume at which the gas condensation begins. Second, the higher the temperature, the greater the volume occupied by the liquid after all the gas has condensed. Consequently, the length of the straight section of the isotherm, corresponding to the equilibrium between liquid and gas, decreases with increasing temperature. Condensation begins at higher gas densities and ends at lower liquid densities. In other words, the higher the temperature, the closer the gas and liquid densities are to each other at the same pressure.</p>

        <p>At sufficiently high temperatures, the horizontal part of the isotherm becomes very short, and at a certain temperature it becomes a point. This temperature is called <em>critical</em>. Each substance is characterized by its own critical temperature. For example, for carbon dioxide \((CO_2)\) the critical temperature is \(T_c \approx 31^0C\), and for water \(T_c \approx 374^0C\).</p>

        <p>The state corresponding to the point to which the horizontal part of the isotherm is turned at \(T=T_c\) is called a <em>critical state</em> (critical point). The pressure in this state is also called <em>critical</em>. For carbon dioxide this pressure is \(73~atm\), and for water \(p_0 \approx 218~atm\). In the critical state, this mass of matter occupies a certain <em>critical volume</em>.</p>

        <p>If the gas is compressed and the temperature is maintained at a critical point, its density will gradually increase until it reaches (in a critical state) the density of the liquid at the same temperature and pressure. With further compression, there will be one liquid in the cylinder under the piston. The transition of a substance from a gaseous state to a liquid at a critical temperature occurs smoothly and imperceptibly without the formation of a liquid-gas interface. There is no area in which the liquid and gas are in a state of equilibrium simultaneously. In the critical state, gas and liquid do not differ from each other.</p>

        <p>To observe the critical state, let's take a transparent sealed container, the volume of which is equal to the critical volume for a given gas mass. Let's start heating the liquid in the container. As we approach the critical temperature, we can see how the liquid-vapor interface becomes weakly defined and unstable. In the critical state it disappears.</p>

        <p>When cooling, a dense fog appears that fills the entire container. This produces droplets of liquid. They are then merged together and the interface between the liquid at the bottom and the vapour at the top appears again.</p>

        <p>The best way to observe the described phenomena is to take the <strong>Ether</strong>, as it has a comparatively low critical pressure (about \(36 ~atm\)). Its critical temperature is also low: \(194^0C\).<br>At critical temperature the difference between gas and liquid disappears, and therefore the heat of vaporization becomes zero.</p>

        <p>The table shows the critical temperatures of some substances found experimentally.<a name="table43"></a></p>

        <table class="table">
          <tr><th>Substance</th><th class="text-right">Critical temperature, \(^0C\)</th></tr>

        <p>Now, let's compress the gas, keeping the temperature above critical. Let's start with very large volumes as before.</p>

        <p>A decrease in volume at a constant temperature greater than critical will result in an increase in pressure according to the ideal gas equation of state. However, if at temperatures below critical at a certain pressure condensation occurred, now the formation of liquid in the container is not observed at all. <strong>At temperatures above the critical gas can not be converted into a liquid at any pressure.</strong> This is the main meaning of the concept of critical temperature.</p>

Let's connect all left ends of horizontal isotherms, i.e. all those points that correspond to the end of condensation and the beginning of liquid compression. A smooth curve ending at the critical point \(C\) is formed. Figure 4 shows this curve with a dotted line. To the left of the dotted \(AC\) curve between it and the critical isotherm (\(RC\) isotherm section) is the area corresponding to the liquid state of the substance (in Figure 4, this area is covered by horizontal dashed). Each point of this region corresponds to the parameters \(p, ~V, ~T\), characterizing the liquid in a state of thermal equilibrium.</p>

(The unsaturated vapour area in Figure 4 is covered with a diagonal dash.) Above the critical isotherm is the gas area. At \(T>T_c\), gas properties are close to the properties of an ideal gas.

Therefore, the pressure of saturated vapour does not depend on the volume, but only on the temperature. This dependence of \(p(T)\), found experimentally, is shown in Figure 1. It is not linear, as is the case with ideal gas at a constant volume. The slope of the curve expressing the dependence of \(p(T)\) on the <em>T-axis</em> is greater when the temperature is higher. Consequently, the pressure at higher temperatures increases with temperature rise faster than at lower temperatures. On the other hand, the state of vapour up to saturation can be approximately described by the ideal gas equation <a href="../chapter1/book3-10.html" class="text-muted">(1-12)</a></p>

        <p><h5 class="mb-4 text-center">\( pV = \frac{m}{\mu}RT \)</h5></p>

        <p>As the temperature rises the increase in saturated vapour pressure is faster than in ideal gas for the following reason.</p>

        <p>When the liquid with vapour in a closed container heats up, part of the liquid is vaporized. As a result, the density of vapour rises, so that a slight increase in the volume occupied by vapour is followed by a significant increase in its mass. As a result, the pressure increases not only by increasing the temperature, but also by increasing the density of vapour. When all the liquid has evaporated, the vapour will no longer be saturated with further heated and its pressure will be linearly dependent on temperature (Fig. 2).</p>

        <p>At the same time as the pressure of saturated vapour increases as the temperature increases, so does the density of the vapour. On the contrary, the density of the liquid in equilibrium with its vapour decreases with the expansion of the liquid during heating. If we draw in one figure the curves of the liquid density and its vapor dependence on temperature, the curve will go down for the liquid and up for the vapor (Fig. 3). At critical temperature both curves merge, i.e. the density of the liquid becomes equal to the density of vapour. The difference between liquid and vapour disappears.</p>

        <p>Any gas can be converted into a liquid by simple compression, unless its temperature is below critical. Therefore, the division of substances into liquids and gases is largely conditional. The substances that we are used to considering as gases simply have very low critical temperatures and therefore cannot be in a liquid state at temperatures close to room temperature. On the contrary, the substances we classify as liquids have high critical temperatures (see table in <a href="../chapter4/book3-43.html#table43" class="text-muted">\(\S 43\)</a>).</p>

        <p>All gases that make up the air (except carbon dioxide) have low critical temperatures. Their liquefaction therefore requires <em>deep cooling</em>.</p>

        <p>There are many types of machines for producing liquid gases, in particular liquid air.<br>
In modern industrial plants, significant cooling and liquefaction of gases is achieved by expansion under thermal insulation conditions.<br>
These machines are called detander (turboexpanders). Expanding gas performs the work by moving the piston (piston expanders) or rotating the turbine (turbine expanders Kapitsa) using its internal energy and therefore cools down.</p>

        <p>Figure 1 shows a simplified scheme of a piston detander (expander). The atmospheric air enters into compressor <strong>A</strong>, where it is compressed to a pressure of several tens of atmospheres. The gas heated by compression is cooled down in the heat exchanger <strong>C</strong> by running water and arrives in the cylinder of a detander <strong>B</strong>. Here the gas performs the work, pushing the piston, and cools down so strongly that it condenses into the liquid.</p>

        <p>Liquid air has a boiling point of \(-193^0C\) at atmospheric pressure. And various gases, of which it consists, boil at different temperatures. The lowest boiling point has helium, neon, nitrogen and argon. Oxygen has a slightly higher boiling temperature. Using the difference in boiling point, it is possible to extract gases from the liquid air. Gases with a low boiling temperature evaporate most rapidly, for example, nitrogen evaporates before oxygen. This is the basis for the industrial production of inert gases, which exist in small quantities in the air. Inert gases are widely used to fill electric incandescent and gaslight bulbs (see <a href="../chapter10/book3-109.html" class="text-muted">\(\S 109\)</a>).</p>

        <p>Liquid gases are stored in special containers called Dewar containers. The Dewar container is designed in the same way as a regular thermos. It has double glass walls, with air being pumped out of the space between them. This reduces the thermal conductivity of the container. The inner wall is made shiny (silver plated) to reduce the heat generated by the radiation. In a good Dewar container, liquid air is stored for a few days.</p>

        <p>Liquefied gases are widely used in practice. Nitrogen is used for the production of ammonia, an important chemical raw material. The use of inert gases has already been mentioned. The most important is liquid oxygen. It is used in metal processing (oxygen blowing), and for medical purposes.  The engines of the first space rockets were powered by liquid oxygen.</p>

        <h2 class="blog-post-title mb-4">47. Air humidity</h2>

        <p><strong>Water vapor in the atmosphere.</strong> Water vapour in the air is not saturated despite the huge surface of oceans, seas, lakes and rivers. The movement of air masses, which is ultimately caused by the radiation of the Sun, leads to the fact that in some places of our planet at the moment the evaporation of water prevails over condensation, while in others, on the contrary, condensation prevails.</p><br>

        <p><strong>Absolute humidity.</strong> The air containing water vapour is called humid. The partial pressure of the water vapour contained in the air, or, as they say, the elasticity of the water vapour, can be assumed to be one of the indicators of air humidity. It is measured in pressure units (\(N/m^2\) or \(mmHg\))</p>

        <p><h5 class="text-center">\(1 \frac{N}{m^2} \approx 0.0075 ~mmHg\)</h5></p>

        <p><strong>The mass of water vapour contained in \(1 ~m^3\) of air may also be taken as a characteristic of air humidity. This value is called absolute humidity and is measured in density units (usually in \(g/m^3\)).</strong><br>
Absolute humidity and elasticity of water vapors are related by the equation of state \( p = \frac{1}{\mu} \frac{m}{V} RT = \frac{\rho}{\mu} RT\).</p><br>

        <p><strong>Relative humidity.</strong> Knowledge of absolute humidity (or water vapor elasticity) does not indicate how far water vapor is from saturation under these conditions. Namely, the intensity of water evaporation (or its condensation) and, consequently, the loss of moisture by living organisms depends on it. That is why <em>relative humidity</em> is introduced, which shows how far water vapor at a given temperature is from saturation.<br>
<strong>The relative humidity \(r\) is the ratio of the elasticity \(p\) of the water vapour contained in the air at a given temperature to the pressure \(p_0\) of the saturated vapour at the same temperature, expressed as a percentage</strong></p>

        <p><h5 class="text-center">\(r = \frac{p}{p_0} \times 100\%\)</h5></p><br>

        <p><strong>Dew point.</strong> When cooling humid air at constant pressure, its relative humidity increases, because the lower the temperature, the closer the elasticity of vapour in the air to the elasticity of saturated vapour. Eventually, the vapour becomes saturated. The temperature at which the water vapour becomes saturated is called <em>the dew point</em>.<br>
When the air cools down to the dew point, the condensation of vapors begins, the fog appears and the dew falls out.<br>
The dew point also characterizes the humidity of the air, because it allows you to determine the partial pressure of the water vapor with the help of the table of the dependence of the saturated vapor pressure on temperature.</p>

        <p><strong>Hygrometers.</strong> Humidity is measured with special instruments, <em>hygrometers and psychrometers.</em><br>The condensation hygrometer allows to detect the dew point. The simplest device of this type is made of a metal box, the front wall of which is well polished. Inside the box, an easily evaporating liquid ether is poured and a thermometer is inserted. Running air through the box with a pump causes strong evaporation of ether and quick cooling of the box. The thermometer notices the temperature at which dew droplets appear on the polished wall surface. The appearance of dew indicates that the water vapor has become saturated.</p>

        <p><strong>Psychrometer.</strong> Psychrometer consists of two thermometers, dry and wet. The dry thermometer shows the air temperature, while the wet thermometer shows its own temperature, depending on the intensity of evaporation of water from the wet batiste fabric surrounding its tank. The readings of the wet thermometer are the lower, the lower the relative humidity. Using special tables on the temperature difference between the two thermometers, it is possible to find humidity.</p>

        <p><strong>The value of humidity.</strong> The value of humidity determines the intensity of moisture evaporation from the skin surface. And moisture evaporation is important for keeping body temperature constant. In spacecraft, the same certain humidity is maintained along with air temperature and pressure. This is necessary to ensure the high performance of astronauts. Relative humidity of 60-70% is most friendly for humans. Air humidity affects the behavior of insects and animals. It is interesting that at 100% humidity mosquitoes stop biting.</p>

      <h3 class="pb-4 mb-4 font-italic border-bottom">From the Surface tension in liquids</h3>

      <div class="blog-post">
        <h2 class="blog-post-title mb-4">48. Surface tension</h2>

        <p>In the world of everyday life that surrounds us, along with gravity, elasticity and friction, there is another force that we usually ignore. This force is relatively small, its actions never produce eye-catching effects. Nevertheless, we cannot pour water into the glass, nothing can be done with any liquid without triggering the forces we are now talking about. These are the forces of <em>surface tension.</em></p>

        <p>We are so used to the effects caused by surface tension that we do not notice them if we do not have fun launching soap bubbles. However, these effects play a significant role in nature and our lives. Without them, we couldn't write in ink. An ordinary brush would not scoop paint out of a can, but would immediately put a large stain. We couldn't wash our hands, foam wouldn't form. A slight rain would have soaked us through, and the rainbow would have been impossible to see in any weather. The water regime of the soil would be disturbed, which would be disastrous for the plants.</p>

        <p>The easiest way to capture the nature of surface tension forces is to observe a drop in a poorly closed or faulty hydrant. Look closely at how the drip grows, the neck is narrowed, and the drip tears off. It does not take much fantasy to imagine that the water is as if enclosed in an elastic bag and this bag breaks when the weight of the water exceeds its strength. In fact, of course, nothing but water in the drop, but the surface layer of water itself behaves like a stretched elastic film.</p>

        <p>Soap bubble film makes the same impression. It's like the thin, stretched rubber of a baby ball. Carefully place the needle on the water surface. The surface film will bend out and prevent the needle from drowning. For the same reason, lightweight water striders can glide quickly on the water surface like skaters on ice.</p>

        <p>The deflection of the film does not allow water to pour out, which is gently poured into a sufficiently frequent sieve. The fabric is the same sieve formed by a weave of threads. Surface tension makes it very difficult for water to seep through, so it does not get wet instantly.</p>

        <p>In its effort to shrink, the surface film would have given the liquid a spherical shape if there was no attraction to the Earth. The smaller the droplet, the greater the role of surface forces compared to volume forces (gravity). Small droplets of dew are therefore close in shape to the ball. A free fall results in a state of weightlessness (zero gravity) and therefore rain droplets are almost exactly spherical. Due to the refraction of the sun's rays, a rainbow arises in these droplets. If the droplets were not spherical, there would be no rainbow.<br>In a spaceship in a state of zero gravity, large masses of liquids take the spherical form.</p>

        <p>The appearance of surface tension forces can be explained as follows. If a large group of individuals has the property of attracting each other or if individuals rush to each other at will, the result will be the same: they will gather in a lump  like a bee swarm. Each individual strives inside this lump, and the surface of the lump shrinks, approaching a sphere.</p>

        <p>The molecules of water or other liquids that are attracted to each other tend to get closer. Each molecule on the surface is attracted by the other molecules inside the liquid and therefore tends to sink deeper. Since the liquid flows because of the jump of molecules from one sedentary position to another, it takes the form in which the number of molecules on the surface is minimal. And the minimum surface at the given volume has a ball. The surface of the liquid is reduced, and it is perceived as surface tension.</p>

        <p>Here we find that the origin of surface forces is quite different from the elastic forces of a stretched rubber film. And it's true. As rubber shrinks, the elastic force weakens, but the surface tension forces do not change as the surface of the film shrinks, because the density of the liquid, and therefore the average distance between the molecules on the surface, does not change.</p>

        <p>Therefore, the appearance of surface forces cannot be explained as easily as the elastic forces, where everything is connected with the change of distance between the molecules. Here, it is more and more complicated, because the surface tension forces are revealed by complex rearrangement of the shape of the whole liquid without changing its volume.</p>

        <h2 class="blog-post-title mb-4">49. Molecular picture of the surface layer</h2>

        <p>Now let's move on to a more detailed acquaintance with surface tension.</p>

        <p>The molecules at the interface and the two environments are in different conditions than the molecules at the depth of the liquid. The molecule at the depth of the liquid is surrounded from all sides by neighboring molecules. The molecule at the liquid surface gets the influence of other molecules only from the liquid side. The vapor density at temperatures far from critical is much lower than the liquid density (Fig. 1). Consequently, the forces of interaction of the molecule at the surface with the molecules of vapour can be neglected.</p>

        <p>Remember that molecules are attracted to each other at a distance of the order of several molecular radii and repelled at very close distances. Attraction forces acting on a surface layer molecule from all other molecules give an equal, downward force. However, from the side of neighboring molecules, the repulsion forces act on the given molecule. Thanks to this, the molecule is in equilibrium. It is true that any molecule participates in heat movement. But for liquid molecules, this movement is reduced to fluctuations near some equilibrium positions. And from time to time molecules change their equilibrium positions. In place of the molecule that has gone deep into the liquid, another molecule comes, etc.</p>

        <div class="mx-auto d-block mt-4 mb-4 text-center">
      		<img src="../common/img/book3-pic27.png" class="img-fluid" alt="...">
      	</div>

        <p>As a result of the forces of attraction and repulsion, the density of liquid in the surface layer is lower than inside. In fact, molecule \(1\) (Fig. 2) is affected by the repulsion force of molecule \(2\) and the force of attraction of all other molecules \(3, 4, 5\) and so on. Molecule \(2\) is affected by the same force of attraction on the side of molecules in the depth and the same force of repulsion on the side of molecule \(3\). But, in addition, there is also the force of repulsion on the side of molecule \(1\). It brings the molecules \(2-3\) closer. As a result, the distance \(1-2\) is on average greater than the distance \(2-3\). The distance \(2-3\) is greater than the distance \(3-4\), etc., until the proximity of molecules to the surface stops affecting it. Thus, <strong>the molecules of the surface layer are on average at greater distances from each other than the molecules inside the liquid</strong>. Therefore, the increase in the liquid surface is accompanied by the appearance of new areas of the rarefied surface layer. And it requires performing work against the forces of attraction between the molecules.</p>

      </div><!-- /.blog-post -->

      <div class="blog-post">
        <h2 class="blog-post-title mb-4">50. Surface energy</h2>

        <p>The work performed when new areas of the rarefied surface layer appear increases the potential energy, which is called <em>surface energy</em>. Surface energy is the excess potential energy of surface layer molecules compared to the energy of molecules inside a liquid.</p>

        <p>If two environment (two liquids or a liquid and hard body) border, both layers close to the border have special properties. The surface energy is equal to the difference between the energy of the molecules of the surface layers of both bodies environment and the energy that the same molecules would possess if they were inside the respective bodies.</p>

        <p>With each new surface area, the surface energy increases. The surface energy \(U_a ~\) is proportional to the area \(A\) of the interface surface</p>

        <p><h5 class="text-center">\( U_a ~= ~\sigma A \) </h5></p><br>

        <p>The proportionality coefficient \(\sigma\) depends on the nature of the boundary bodies environment and their condition, mainly temperature. It is called <em>surface tension coefficient</em> and can be measured in joules per square meter (in SI).</p>

        <p>When the surface area is reduced, the surface energy is decreased, and the liquid performs positive work. In a state of equilibrium, the surface energy is of minimal value. Liquid takes the form of a ball if there are no other forces distorting its natural spherical shape.</p>

        <p>As the temperature rises, the difference between the liquid and the saturated vapour of the liquid gradually disappears and at critical temperatures disappears completely. Therefore, the surface tension coefficient for the boundary between liquid and saturated vapour decreases as the temperature rises and becomes zero at critical temperature.</p>

        <h2 class="blog-post-title mb-4">51. The force of surface tension</h2>

        <p>Let's find the magnitude and direction of the surface tension forces. The easiest way to do this is to use a rectangular wire frame, one side of which length \(l\) can move horizontally with low friction (Fig. 1). By dipping the frame in soapy water, it is easy to get a soapy film stretched on the frame. Immediately after that, you can see the crossbar move. The soapy film will shrink its surface. This means that forces perpendicular to the bar are acting on the bar in the direction of the soap film. These are the forces of surface tension. They can be easily measured by applying a force \(F_1\) to the crossbar that would keep the crossbar in equilibrium.</p>

        <div class="mx-auto d-block mt-4 mb-4 text-center">
      		<img src="../common/img/book3-pic28.png" class="img-fluid" alt="...">
      	</div>

        <p>When the bar is moved on the section \(x\), the surface tension force \(F\) will perform the work</p>

        <p><h5 class="text-center">\( W ~= 2F_x \) </h5></p><br>

        <p>Multiplier \(2\) appears because the soap film has two surfaces and force \(F\) is applied along each surface.<br>According to the law of energy conservation, this work is equal to a change in potential (surface in this case) energy taken with the opposite sign</p>

        <p><h5 class="text-center">\( W ~= -\Delta(U_s) ~= -(2A_2\sigma - 2A_1\sigma) ~= ~2\sigma(A_1-A_2)\) </h5></p>

        <p>where \(A_1\) and \(A_2\) are the starting and ending areas of the soap film.<br>Obviously,
        <h5 class="text-center">\( l_x ~= ~A_1-A_2\)</h5>
        and hence,<br><h5 class="text-center">\( W ~= ~2F_x ~= ~2\sigma{l_x} \)</h5></p><br>

        <p>From here, the surface tension force acting on a line of length (l_x) at the border of one of the surfaces is equal to</p>

        <p><h5 class="text-center">\( F ~= ~\sigma{l_x} \) <span class="float-right">(5-1)</span></h5></p><br>

        <p>The force of surface tension is directed tangentially to the body surface and perpendicular to the line limiting this surface (perpendicular to the bar in our case). The force is proportional to the length, and the coefficient of proportionality is the coefficient of surface tension. According to the equation \((5-1)\), the surface tension coefficient \(\sigma\) is measured in newtons per meter (in SI).</p>

        <p>This experiment makes it possible to measure the surface tension coefficient. To do this you need to know the length of the bar \(l\) and the force \(F_1\) that keeps the bar in equilibrium.</p>

        <p>The table shows the surface tension coefficients for liquids on their border with air.</p>

        <h2 class="blog-post-title mb-4">52. Pressure under curved liquid surface</h2>

        <p>In its effort to reduce, the surface film of the liquid creates additional pressure inside the liquid. For this reason, the pressure inside the soap bubble is greater than the atmospheric pressure. This overpressure depends on the curvature of the liquid surface or the soapy film. The easiest way to find the overpressure \(p\) for a spherical surface.</p>

        <p>We will increase the size of the spherical drop by injecting liquid into it with a very thin syringe. Let the volume of the droplet increase from \(V_1\) to \(V_2\), and the increase in the volume of \(\Delta{V} ~= ~V_2-V_1 \) is very small (Fig. 1). As is known (see <a href="../chapter1/book3-12.html" class="text-muted">\(\S{12}\))</a>, the work of the pressure forces when the volume changes by \(\Delta{V}\) equals \(p\Delta{V}\). In this case, the work of the overpressure forces \(\Delta{W} ~=  -p_s\Delta{V}\).</p>

        <div class="mx-auto d-block mt-4 mb-4 text-center">
      		<img src="../common/img/book3-pic29.png" class="img-fluid" alt="...">
      	</div>

        <p>The work \(\Delta{W}\) is negative because the overpressure force acting on the surface element is pointing in the opposite direction to the displacement of the surface element. It is equal to the change in potential (surface) energy taken with the opposite sign</p>

        <p><h5 class="text-center">\( \Delta{W} ~= ~-p_s\Delta{V} ~= ~-\Delta{U_s} ~= ~-\sigma{(A_2-A_1)} \)</h5></p>

        <p><h5 class="text-center">\( p_s\Delta{V} ~= ~\sigma\Delta{A} \) <span class="float-right">(5-2)</span></h5></p><br>

        <p>Let's calculate the ball volume change and ball surface area change with small radius \(\Delta{r}\) increase.</p>

        <p>
          <h4 class="text-center">\( \Delta{V} ~= ~\frac{4\pi}{3}(r+\Delta{r})^3 - \frac{4\pi}{3}r^3 ~\approx ~4\pi{r^2}\Delta{r} \) <span class="float-right">(5-3)</span></h4>
        </p>

        <p>
          <h5 class="text-center">\( \Delta{A} ~= ~4\pi(r+\Delta{r})^2 - 4\pi{r^2} ~\approx ~8\pi{r}\Delta{r} \) <span class="float-right">(5-4)</span></h5>
        </p><br>

        <p>Here we have neglected members proportional to \(\Delta{r^2}\) and \(\Delta{r^3}\) because they are small. By placing \((5-3)\) and \((5-4)\) in equation \((5-2)\), we get the desired result.</p>

        <p>The overpressure inside a spherical droplet is</p>

        <p><h4 class="text-center">\( p_s ~= \frac{2\sigma}{r} \) <span class="float-right">(5-5)</span></h4></p><br>

        <p>Therefore, the presence of a spherical shape of the interface surface of two bodies environment leads to the appearance of additional pressure \((5-5)\) in one of the body environment.</p>

        <h2 class="blog-post-title mb-4">53. Capillary phenomena</h2>

        <p>The curved surface of the fluid is easiest to observe in thin tubes - capillaries. This is caused by wetting and non-wetting phenomena. The fact is that if the forces of attraction between the molecules of liquid and gas can be neglected, then the attraction between the molecules of liquid and molecules of solid body tube can not be neglected. Therefore, the shape of the surface of the liquid that is in contact with the solid body will depend on whether the forces of attraction between the molecules of liquid and solid are greater or between the molecules of liquid.</p>

        <p>In the first case, the liquid will be wetting and its shape at the wall of the capillary is such (Fig. 1), that the angle \(\Theta\) between the surface of the liquid and the wall is sharp. (Liquid sticking to the wall.) In the second case, the liquid does not wet the solid surface and the angle \(\Theta\) is blunt between the surface of the liquid and the wall (Fig. 2 - the liquid pull off the wall).</p>

        <div class="mx-auto d-block mt-4 mb-4 text-center">
      		<img src="../common/img/book3-pic30.png" class="img-fluid rounded-lg" alt="...">
      	</div>

        <p>Lets study cases of total wetting (angle \(\Theta ~= ~0^0 \)) and total non-wetting (angle \(\Theta ~= ~180^0 \)).<br>In thin tubes, the curved surface of the liquid can be assumed to be a hemisphere, the radius of which \(R\) is the radius of the tube's channel \(r\) when fully wetted or not wetted. (<small>In case of incomplete wetting (or non-wetting), the curved surface of the liquid in thin tubes is also taken as part of the surface of a sphere, the radius of which \(R\) is associated with the radius of the tube \(r\) with a ratio \(r ~= R\cos\Theta\) (Fig. 3).</small>)<br>Right above the surface of the liquid the pressure (equal to atmospheric pressure) is higher than inside the liquid by the value of overpressure (5-5)</p>

        <p><h4 class="text-center">\( p_s ~= \frac{2\sigma}{R} \)</h4></p><br>

        <p>Therefore, the liquid in the capillary and in the wide container (Fig. 4) cannot be at the same level. In a capillary with liquid wetting the walls, it must rise to such a height \(h\) that the pressure \(p_b\) at point \(B\) at the base of the capillary and the pressure \(p_c\) at the same level at point \(C\) in a wide container are the same. But,</p>

        <p><h5 class="text-center">\( p_c ~= ~p_b ~= ~p_a\)</h5></p>

        <p>where \(p_a\) is atmospheric pressure and pressure \(p_b\) can be written as</p>

        <p><h5 class="text-center">\( p_b ~= ~p_a + \rho{gh} - \frac{2\sigma}{R} \)</h5></p>

        <p>(here \(\rho{gh}\) is the pressure of the liquid column with height \(h\)). Considering that \(~p_a = p_b \), it is possible to find the height of liquid rise in the capillary</p>

        <p><h4 class="text-center">\( h ~= ~\frac{2\sigma}{\rho{gR}} \) <span class="float-right">(5-6)</span></h4></p>

      	</div>

        <p>The non-wetting liquid in the capillary, on the contrary, drops to a depth of \(h\) (Fig. 5), because in this case the pressure in the liquid is greater by \(\frac{2\sigma}{R}\) than the pressure above the horizontal surface of the liquid.</p>

        <p>Bodies penetrated by a large number of thin channels (capillaries) actively absorb water and other liquids. It is only necessary that the liquids wet the body surface. This is why the towel absorbs water. Rising the water through the capillary fibres of plants plays a very important role in their lives.</p>

      <div class="blog-post">
        <h2 class="blog-post-title mb-4">54. Crystalline bodies</h2>

        <p>A common feature of any solid body is its ability to preserve not only its volume as a liquid, but also its shape. Primarily solid bodies are in <em>the crystalline state.</em></p>

        <p>In the crystal, atoms or molecules occupy certain, ordered positions. This results in the proper external shape of the crystal. For example, a particle of ordinary table salt has flat faces that make up right angles with each other. This can be seen by looking at the salt with a magnifier. And how geometrically correct is the shape of a snowflake! (fig. 1). It also reflects the geometric correctness of the internal structure of a crystalline solid body - ice.</p>

        <p>However, the proper external shape is not the only or even the most important consequence of the ordered structure of the crystal. The main thing is the dependence of physical properties on the direction chosen in the crystal. First of all, it is noticeable that the crystal has different mechanical strength in different directions. A piece of mica is easily split in one direction into thin plates (fig. 2). It is much more difficult to split it in the direction perpendicular to the plates. It is just as easy to split in one direction the graphite crystal. When you write with a pencil, this splitting occurs continuously and thin layers of graphite remain on paper. This is because the graphite crystal lattice has a layered structure. The layers are formed by a series of parallel flat grids consisting of carbon atoms (fig. 3). The atoms are located at the tops of the correct hexagons. The distance between the layers is relatively large: approximately twice as long as the side length of the hexagon. The bonds between the layers are therefore less strong than the bonds inside them.
        </p>

        <div class="mx-auto d-block mt-4 mb-4 text-center">
      		<img src="../common/img/book3-pic32.png" class="img-fluid" alt="...">
      	</div><br>

        <p>Many crystals conduct heat and electric current in different directions. The optical properties of the crystals are also dependent on the direction. Thus, a quartz crystal refracts light in different ways depending on the direction of the rays falling on it.</p>

        <p>The dependence of physical properties on the direction inside the crystalline body is called <em>anisotropy</em>.<br><strong>All crystalline bodies are anisotropic.</strong></p>

        <p>Most solid bodies are crystals. In particular, metals have a crystal structure. However, if we take a relatively large piece of metal, then, at first glance, its crystal structure does not appear either in the outer appearance of the piece, or in its physical properties. Metals in their usual state do not reveal anisotropy.</p>

        <p>The thing here is that usually the metal consists of a huge number of small crystals fused with each other. Under a microscope or even with a magnifying glass, they are easy to see, especially when the metal is freshly broken. The properties of each crystal are different in different directions, but the crystals are oriented towards each other chaotically. As a result, none of the directions is highlighted and the properties of metals are the same in all directions, which means that metals are isotropic.</p>

        <p>A solid body, consisting of a large number of small crystals, is called <em>polycrystalline</em>. In the case of a <em>monocrystal</em>, the whole piece of substance is one crystal.</p>

        <p>With extreme precautions, you can grow a large metal crystal, a single crystal. Under normal conditions, the polycrystalline body is formed as a result of the fact that many crystals simultaneously begin to grow until they come into contact with each other, forming a single body.</p>

        <p>Polycrystals are not just metals. An ordinary piece of sugar also has a polycrystalline structure.</p>

        <p>Along with crystalline solids there also exist <em>amorphous bodies</em>. In contrast to crystals, amorphous bodies have no strict order in the arrangement of atoms. Only the nearest neighboring atoms are in approximate order. But there is no strict repeatability in all directions of the same element of structure, which is typical for crystals, in amorphous bodies.</p>

        <p>Often, the same body may be in both crystalline and amorphous states. For example, quartz (\(SiO_2\)) can be in both crystalline and amorphous form (silica, or silicon dioxide). The crystalline form of quartz can be schematically represented as a grid of regular hexagons (fig. 1). The amorphous structure also has the form of a lattice, but not correct. Along with hexagons there are pentagons and heptagons in the lattice (fig. 2).</p>

        <p>All amorphous bodies are isotropic, their physical properties are the same in all directions. To amorphous bodies belong glass, many plastics, gums, rosin, sugar lollipop.</p>

        <p>Under external influences, amorphous bodies find both elastic properties like solids and fluidity like liquids. Under short-term influences (hit) they behave like a solid body and are split into pieces under a strong hit. But on very long exposures, amorphous bodies flow. For example, a piece of gum gradually spreads over a hard surface. This is due to the fact that atoms or molecules of amorphous bodies, like molecules of liquid, have a certain time of sedentary life - the time of oscillation near the equilibrium position. But unlike liquids, this time is very long. In this respect, amorphous bodies are close to crystalline, because the jump of atoms from one equilibrium position to another occurs rarely.</p>

        <p>At low temperatures, amorphous bodies are more like solid bodies in their properties. They have almost no fluidity. But as temperatures rise, amorphous bodies gradually soften and their properties are more and more like liquids. This is because as the temperature rises, atoms gradually jump from one position of equilibrium to another. There is no definite melting point for amorphous bodies.</p>

        <h2 class="blog-post-title mb-4">56. Melting and hardening of crystalline bodies</h2>

        <p>The melting of crystalline bodies, as you know from the first book, occurs at a strictly defined temperature. Thus, ice melts at normal atmospheric pressure at \(0^0C\), mercury (\(Hg\), Atomic number: 80) at \(-39^0C\), tin (\(Sn\), Atomic number: 50) at \(232^0C\).</p>

        <p>In order to melt, there must be a constant supply of heat. If the inflow of heat is stopped by insulating the system a solid body-liquid, the system will be in equilibrium, the mass of the substance in the crystalline and liquid states will not change. If the system gives heat to colder surrounding bodies, the reverse melting process - <em>crystallization</em> - will begin. The temperature will also be constant and equal to the melting point.</p>

        <p>As the crystalline body heats up, the average kinetic energy of its molecules increases. The potential energy of molecules also increases. Once the melting point is reached, all the energy supplied goes to increase the potential energy of the molecules, since the kinetic energy at a constant temperature remains unchanged. This increase in potential energy will be large, because during melting there is a significant increase in volume in almost all bodies and, therefore, a significant increase in the distance between the molecules.</p>

        <p><strong>The quantity of heat required to convert \(1 kg\) of crystalline substance into a liquid at the same temperature is called the specific heat of melting.</strong></p>

        <p>When the body crystallizes, this amount of heat, on the contrary, is released. That's why it usually gets warmer during a snowfall. Ice melting heat \(3.4 \times 10^5 ~J/kg ~= ~80 ~Cal/g \).</p>

        <p>The melting point of most bodies increases with pressure, just as the boiling point increases with pressure. This can be explained as follows. Compression of the substance prevents an increase in the distance between the molecules and, consequently, an increase in the potential energy of interaction of molecules, which is necessary for transition to the liquid state.</p>

        <p>Some bodies: ice, bismuth (\(Bi\), Atomic number: 83), cast iron (iron, \(Fe\), Atomic number: 26) - when melting reduce their volume and, therefore, increase their density (if it was not so, the ice would sink in the water, not swim). In these bodies, the melting temperature decreases as the pressure increases. This feature is associated with a special form of crystal structure, in which the ordered arrangement of molecules corresponds to a larger volume than the disorder. But even in these bodies the potential energy of molecules grows during melting.</p>

        <p>When the freezing water expands in a closed container, huge forces arise that can tear the thick-walled cast iron ball. This experience is easy to accomplish with a bottle filled with water down the neck and placed out in the freezing cold. An ice cap forms on the surface of the water that plugs the bottle, and as the freezing water expands, the bottle burst.<br>Freezing the water in the cracks at night during frost causes gradual destruction of rocks.</p>

        <h2 class="blog-post-title mb-4">57. Thermal expansion</h2>

        <p>When the body temperature changes, its size changes. However, the increase in size, for example, a small metal rod is so small that it is even hard to notice. In order to see the expansion visible, you can use a long arrow with its axis at one end of the rod (fig. 1). Then, with a small shift of the rod end, the arrow will turn a small angle, but its long end will move along the scale at a fairly large distance.</p>

        <div class="mx-auto d-block mt-4 mb-4 text-center">

      	</div>

        <p>The longer the rod, the larger its size increases when heated, as the temperature rises the length of each section of the rod increases.<br> The extension of bodies when heated is taken into account in the technique. For example, the railway rails are not placed close to each other, but leave small spaces between them. Thanks to the gaps between the rails, the rails do not deform during warm weather.</p>

        <p>Rods made of different materials expand differently when heated. As a result, the plate, riveted from two different metals ( for example copper and iron), bends when heated. This can be explained in this way. When it is free, the copper plate would extend longer than the iron plate. But the plates are bundled together. Therefore, there is a bend, and the copper plate is less extended, while the iron plate, on the contrary, is more extended. The iron plate would be stretched by the forces arising from heating, while the copper plate would be compressed.</p>

        <p>These kinds of internal tensions always occur in solid bodies, bound together, expanding differently when heated, as well as when a homogeneous body is heated unevenly. For example, a glass bottle or cup may burst if hot water is poured into it. The forces generated by expansion caused by heating or compression caused by cooling are very high. Dissimilar materials that are subject to periodic heating and cooling should only be joined together when their dimensions change equally as the temperature changes. This is particularly important when the product is large. For example, iron and concrete expand equally when heated. That is why reinforced concrete is widely used, hardened concrete mortar poured into an iron grid. If concrete and iron expanded differently, as a result of daily and annual temperature fluctuations, the reinforced concrete structure would soon be destroyed.</p>

        <p>When the temperature changes, not only the length changes, but all other linear body dimensions as well. So, at a round rod diameter increases at heating as much as the length of a rod increases. At the plate in the same number of times increases the length, width and thickness.<br> If a plate with a round hole is heated, the diameter of the hole will also increase. The matter is that at uniform heating in a body there are no forces of elasticity. Therefore, the expansion occurs as if the plate was solid.<br> This can be seen from experiments with a metal ball that passes through a metal ring with almost no gap. The ball gets stuck in the ring if it is heated and passes with a large gap if the ring is heated. Conversely, when the ring is cooled, the ball gets stuck, and cooling the ball increases the gap between it and the ring.</p>

        <p>The experiment shows that in case of small temperature changes, the change in linear dimensions of a solid body is proportional to the temperature increase (fig. 1). As lengthening at heating (or shortening at cooling) depends also on initial length of a body, it is more convenient to consider not lengthening of a body itself, but so-called relative lengthening, the ratio of increase in length \(\Delta{l} = l - l_0\) to initial length \(l_0\). The relative lengthening of \(\Delta{l}/l_0\) is proportional to the temperature change \(\Delta{t} = t - t_0\).</p>

        <p><h5 class="text-center">\( \frac{\Delta{l}}{l_0} ~= ~\alpha{\Delta{t}} \) <span class="float-right">(7-1)</span></h5></p><br>

        <p>The proportionality coefficient \(\alpha\) is called <em>the linear expansion coefficient</em>. It shows, on what fraction of the initial size increases length of a body at heating it on \(1^0{Ð¡}\). The coefficient of linear expansion depends on the nature of the substance as well as its temperature. However, if to consider changes of temperature in not too wide limits, it is possible to neglect dependence \(\alpha\) on temperature and to consider factor of linear expansion as a constant for the given substance.</p>

        <p>The body length itself depends on temperature changes as follows</p>

        <p><h5 class="text-center">\( l ~= ~l_0(1 ~+ ~\alpha{\Delta{t}}) \)</h5></p><br>

        <p>For most substances, the \(\alpha\) value is \(10^{-5} - 10^{-6} deg^{-1}\). The linear thermal expansion of the bodies is very small.</p>

        <h2 class="blog-post-title mb-4">59. Thermal volume expansion</h2>

        <p>As at heating all linear sizes of a body increase, its volume should increase also.</p>

        <p>Measurements show that within the limits of not so big interval of temperatures it is possible to consider that increase in body volume is proportional to temperature change. As well as at linear expansion, it is convenient to consider relative change of body volume \(\frac{\Delta{V}}{V_0}=\frac{V-V_0}{V_0}\). Relative change of volume is proportional to change of temperature</p>

        <p><h5 class="text-center">\( \frac{\Delta{V}}{V_0} ~= ~\beta{\Delta{t}} ~= ~\beta(t-t_0) \) <span class="float-right">(7-2)</span></h5></p><br>

        <p>The volume expansion coefficient \(\beta\), which shows how much the body volume will change if the body temperature changes by \(1^0{C}\), depends on the nature of the substance. The insignificant dependence of this coefficient on temperature can be neglected if the interval of temperature change is not very large. For most substances, the coefficient has the order of \(10^{-5} - 10^{-4} deg^{-1}\), which is very small.</p>

        <p>If \(V_0\) is the initial volume at temperature \(t_0\), then the final volume is found by the equation</p>

        <p><h5 class="text-center">\( V ~= ~V_0(1 ~+ ~\beta{\Delta{t}}) \)</h5></p><br>

        <p>The linear expansion coefficient \(\alpha\) and volume expansion coefficient \(\beta\) are related. This relationship can be found by considering the thermal expansion of a simple body, such as a cube with an edge \(l_0\). When a cube heats up by \(\Delta{t}\), each side of the cube will increase by \(\Delta{l}\) and become equal to</p>

        <p><h5 class="text-center">\( l ~= ~l_0(1 ~+ ~\alpha{\Delta{t}}) \) <span class="float-right">(7-3)</span></h5></p>

        <p>But \(V_0 = l{^3_0}\) and \(V = l^3\). By putting \(l\) from \((7-3)\) into equation \((7-4)\), we get</p>

        <p><h5 class="text-center">\( \beta ~= ~3\alpha ~+ ~3\alpha{^2}\Delta{t} ~+ ~\alpha{^3}(\Delta{t})^2 \)</h5></p><br>

        <p>Since \(\alpha\) is very small, with small temperature changes, members \(3\alpha{^2}\Delta{t}\) and \(\alpha{^3}(\Delta{t})^2\) can be neglected compared to members \(3\alpha\). Therefore, \(\beta ~\approx ~3\alpha\).</p>

        <p>Thermal volume expansion is observed in both solids and liquids. The liquids do not retain their shape, and therefore the concept of linear expansion does not apply to them.<br> Changing the volume of liquid when heated in a container leads to an increase in liquid level, which can be measured (fig. 1). The volume expansion coefficients of liquids usually significantly above the volume expansion coefficients of solids, reaching values in the order of \(10^{-3} deg^{-1}\).</p>

        <p>The most common liquid on Earth, water, has special properties in relation to thermal expansion. In contrast to other liquids, the volume of water when heated from \(0\) to \(4^0{C}\) does not increase, but decreases. Only starting from \(4^0{C}\) the volume of water starts to increase when heated. At \(4^0{C}\), the water volume is minimal and the density is maximum. This property of water has a great influence on the nature of heat exchange in water bodies. When water cools down, the density of the upper layers increases at first and they drop downwards. But after reaching a temperature of \(4^0{C}\), further cooling already reduces the density and cold layers of water remain on the surface. As a result, the water has a temperature of around \(4^0{C}\) even at very low air temperatures in deep pools.</p>

        <h2 class="blog-post-title mb-4">60. Molecular picture of thermal expansion</h2>

        <p>The dependence of the potential energy of interaction of molecules on the distance between them allows to explain the reason of thermal expansion. As can be seen from Figure 1, the curve of potential energy is strongly asymmetric. It rises very quickly from the minimum value at the point \(r_0\) with decreasing \(r\) and grows quite slowly with increasing \(r\).</p>

        <div class="mx-auto d-block mt-4 mb-4 text-center">

        <p>At absolute zero in the equilibrium state the molecules would be at a distance of \(r_0\) from each other, corresponding to the minimum value of potential energy \(U_0\). As the molecule heats up, it starts to vibrate near the equilibrium positions. The range of vibrations is determined by the average energy \(E\). If the potential curve was symmetric, then the average position of the molecule would still correspond to the distance \(r_0\). This would mean that the average distance between the molecules would remain the same during heating and, consequently, no thermal expansion. In fact, the curve is asymmetrical. Therefore, at energy \(E_1\) the average position of an oscillating molecule corresponds to distance \(r_1 > r_0 ~(ar_1 > r{_1}b)\).</p>

        <p>Changing the average distance between two neighboring molecules means changing the distance between all molecules of the body. This is why the size of the body increases.</p>

        <p>Further heating the body leads to increase the full energy of the molecule up to some value \(E_2\). In this case the average distance between the molecules also increases, because now the oscillations are performed with greater amplitude around the new equilibrium position, \(r_2 > r_1, ~r_3 > r_2\) and so on.</p>

        <p>So, we see that when the body heats up, the average distance between oscillating molecules increases, so the size of the body also increases. If we know the shape of the potential curve, we can calculate the coefficient of linear expansion. Calculations of this kind are in good agreement with the experiment.</p>
